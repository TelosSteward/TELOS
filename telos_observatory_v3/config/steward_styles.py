"""
Steward Granular Response Styling (PROPRIETARY)
================================================

This module defines the continuous gradient of Steward response styles
for the INTERVENTION ZONE ONLY (fidelity < GREEN threshold).

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
------------------
- Steward only appears when intervention is triggered (< GREEN threshold)
- GREEN zone = TELOS native flow (Steward is INVISIBLE)
- Below GREEN = Steward takes over with graduated intensity

FIDELITY GRADIENT (Intervention Zone Only):
-------------------------------------------
The gradient below GREEN threshold determines Steward's intensity:

    Band 6: 0.60-0.70 (Threshold) - Soft nudge
    Band 5: 0.50-0.60 (Drifting) - Clear inquiry
    Band 4: 0.40-0.50 (Concerning) - Direct check-in
    Band 3: 0.30-0.40 (Problematic) - Firm redirection
    Band 2: 0.20-0.30 (Critical) - Strong intervention
    Band 1: <0.20 (Collapsed) - Full governance mode

NOTE: These are Mistral thresholds. For SentenceTransformer, use:
    GREEN = 0.30 (so Steward appears at < 0.30)

Each band has:
- Tone descriptor (how Steward sounds)
- Directness level (0.0-1.0)
- Urgency level (0.0-1.0)
- Response openers (example phrases)
- Prompt injection template

Usage:
    from config.steward_styles import get_steward_style, get_intervention_prompt

    # Only call when fidelity < GREEN (intervention triggered)
    style = get_steward_style(fidelity=0.58, green_threshold=0.70)
    prompt = get_intervention_prompt(fidelity=0.58, user_context="debugging code")

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TELOS is a mathematical governance framework for AI alignment that treats alignment as a continuous process control problem, not a one-time training task. It implements session-level governance through **Primacy Attractors** (embedding-space representations of user purpose) with real-time fidelity measurement, proportional intervention, and forensic audit trails.

**Validation Results:**
- **Adversarial Robustness:** 2,550 attacks, 0% ASR (95% CI upper bound: <0.12%, Rule of Three)
- **Operational Coverage:** 46 multi-session governance evaluations
- **Over-Refusal Calibration:** 8.0% FPR (healthcare PA) vs 24.8% (generic PA)
- **Regulatory Alignment:** EU AI Act, California SB 53, HIPAA-ready

## 1. CORE GOVERNANCE COMPONENTS

### 1.1 Fidelity Tracking & Drift Detection

**Location:** `telos_core/`

#### A. Two-Layer Fidelity System (`fidelity_engine.py`, `constants.py`)

**Layer 1: Baseline Pre-Filter**
- Raw cosine similarity threshold: `SIMILARITY_BASELINE = 0.20`
- Catches content completely outside the PA embedding space
- Triggers `HARD_BLOCK` for extreme off-topic content
- Model-specific thresholds:
  - SentenceTransformer (384-dim): `ST_FIDELITY_GREEN = 0.32`
  - Mistral Embed (1024-dim): `MISTRAL_FIDELITY_GREEN = 0.60`

**Layer 2: Basin Membership Testing**
- Basin center: `BASIN_CENTER = 0.50`
- Basin tolerance: `BASIN_TOLERANCE = 0.02`
- Intervention threshold: `INTERVENTION_THRESHOLD = 0.48`
- Detects purpose drift through normalized fidelity score

**Implementation:**
```python
# From fidelity_engine.py
FidelityResult = dataclass with:
  - raw_similarity: Float (0-1)
  - normalized_fidelity: Float (0-1)
  - layer1_hard_block: Bool
  - layer2_outside_basin: Bool
  - zone: FidelityZone (GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED)
  - should_intervene: Bool
```

**Fidelity Zones (UI Coloring):**
| Zone | Fidelity | Color | Meaning |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| GREEN | >= 0.70 | #27ae60 | Aligned (no intervention) |
| YELLOW | 0.60-0.69 | #f39c12 | Minor drift (context injection) |
| ORANGE | 0.50-0.59 | #e67e22 | Drift detected (Steward redirect) |
| RED | < 0.50 | #e74c3c | Significant drift (block + review) |

#### B. Cumulative Drift Detection (SAAI Framework)

**Location:** `governance_trace.py`, `evidence_schema.py`

Per Safer Agentic AI (SAAI) Framework integration:

```
SAAI_DRIFT_WARNING = 0.10  (10% cumulative drift)
  └─ Event: mandatory_review_triggered
  └─ Response: Operator notification, log escalation event

SAAI_DRIFT_RESTRICT = 0.15  (15% cumulative drift)
  └─ Response: Tighten thresholds to stricter enforcement
  └─ Flexibility scales inversely with drift magnitude

SAAI_DRIFT_BLOCK = 0.20  (20% cumulative drift)
  └─ Response: Halt AI responses until human acknowledgment
  └─ Graceful degradation endpoint
```

**Baseline Establishment:**
- First `BASELINE_TURN_COUNT = 3` turns define "normal operation"
- Event: `baseline_established` (turn 3 after PA formation)
- Baseline fidelities tracked in cryptographic hash chain

---

### 1.2 Error Signal & Proportional Control (`proportional_controller.py`, `primacy_math.py`)

**Proportional Control Law:**
```
F = K·e_t

where:
  K = proportional gain (1.5 default, 2.0 for meta-suppression)
  e_t = normalized error distance (1.0 - current_fidelity)
  F = correction force (capped at 1.0)
```

**Error Thresholds (Scale with τ):**
```
ε_min = 0.1 + (0.3 × τ)  → CORRECT state trigger
ε_max = 0.5 + (0.4 × τ)  → INTERVENE state trigger

where τ = constraint_tolerance ∈ [0, 1]
```

**Basin Radius Computation:**
```
r = 2 / max(ρ, 0.25)

where ρ = 1 - τ (constraint rigidity)
  τ = 0.0 (rigid):    r = 2.0 (tight basin)
  τ = 0.5 (balanced): r ≈ 2.67
  τ = 1.0 (loose):    r = 8.0 (wide basin)
```

**Intervention Budget:**
- `MAX_REGENERATIONS = 3` per session
- `INTERVENTION_BUDGET_PER_SESSION = 10` soft limit
- Prevents infinite loops while allowing transient drift correction

---

### 1.3 Primacy State Formalization (`primacy_state.py`)

**Dual Formula (Public):**
```
PS = ρ_PA × (2·F_user·F_AI) / (F_user + F_AI)

where:
  ρ_PA = PA correlation (synchronization metric)
  F_user = User PA fidelity (conversation alignment)
  F_AI = AI PA fidelity (behavioral alignment)
  PS ∈ [0, 1]
```

**Trifecta Formula (Proprietary, Healthcare):**
```
PS = ρ_PA × 3 / (1/F_user + 1/F_AI + 1/F_steward)

Adds third component:
  F_steward = Therapeutic care alignment
  Steward has FINAL SAY (gatekeeper authority)
```

**Primacy State Conditions:**
- `achieved` (PS >= 0.76): Aligned
- `weakening` (0.73-0.76): Minor drift warning
- `violated` (0.67-0.73): Drift detected
- `collapsed` (< 0.67): Significant misalignment

---

## 2. SAFETY & SECURITY FEATURES

### 2.1 Cryptographic Audit Trails (`governance_trace.py`)

**Hash Chain Implementation:**

```python
# Each event includes hash of previous event
_last_hash: str = "0" * 64  # Genesis hash

# When event recorded:
current_event_hash = SHA256(previous_hash + event_data)
```

**Tamper Detection:**
- Cryptographic hash chain creates tamper-evident trail
- Any modification invalidates all downstream hashes
- Full JSONL format for Elasticsearch/Splunk integration

**Privacy Modes:**

| Mode | Content | Hashes | Use Case |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| FULL | Complete data | Included | Regulated environments |
| HASHED | SHA-256 only | Computed | Privacy-preserving verification |
| DELTAS_ONLY | Metrics only | Excluded | Minimal collection (default) |

### 2.2 Governance Trace Schema (`evidence_schema.py`)

**Unified Event Model:** 11 governance event types

```
1. SESSION_START
2. PA_ESTABLISHED
3. TURN_START
4. FIDELITY_CALCULATED
5. INTERVENTION_TRIGGERED
6. RESPONSE_GENERATED
7. SSE_TOKEN (server-sent events)
8. SSE_GOVERNANCE (real-time updates)
9. TURN_COMPLETE
10. SESSION_END
11. SESSION_SUMMARY

# SAAI Framework Events:
12. MANDATORY_REVIEW_TRIGGERED
13. BASELINE_ESTABLISHED
```

**Per-Event Data:**
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Session ID
- Turn number
- Fidelity metrics (raw & normalized)
- Decision (tier/action)
- Intervention details
- Hash of previous event

**Regulatory Compliance Audit Trail Contains:**
- Session initialization with PA configuration
- Per-turn fidelity calculations with raw similarity scores
- Intervention decisions with tier classification and rationale
- Complete JSONL for log aggregation

**Published Evidence:**
- 11,208 governance events across 2,550 attacks
- Full forensic traces for every decision
- DOI-cited datasets for reproducibility

---

### 2.3 Meta-Commentary Suppression

**Detection Patterns:** (`constants.py`)

```python
META_COMMENTARY_PATTERNS = [
    r'\bmy purpose is\b',
    r'\bmy constraints\b',
    r'\bi am designed to\b',
    r'\bmy guardrails\b',
    r'\baccording to my instructions\b',
    r'\bas an ai language model\b',
    r'\bas a large language model\b'
]
```

**Suppression Mechanism:**
- Higher proportional gain: `K_ANTIMETA = 2.0` (vs 1.5 default)
- Prepends context injection or applies regeneration
- Prevents model from discussing its own governance

---

## 3. HUMAN OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS

### 3.1 Graduated Intervention Architecture (`semantic_interpreter.py`)

**Four-State Governance Decision:**

```
State 1: MONITOR (F >= 0.76)
  └─ No action needed, conversation aligned

State 2: CORRECT (0.73 ≤ F < 0.76)
  └─ Context injection (lightweight reminder)
  └─ Hedged language, implicit drift acknowledgment

State 3: INTERVENE (0.67 ≤ F < 0.73)
  └─ Steward redirect with constraints
  └─ Regeneration or guided conversation

State 4: ESCALATE (F < 0.67)
  └─ Block response, require human review
  └─ SAAI Block-level drift threshold (20%)
```

**Linguistic Specification Scaling:**

Per `SemanticSpec` dataclass, corrections are proportionally scaled:

- **Sentence Form:** questions → soft statements → directives
- **Hedging:** heavy (might, could) → light (maybe) → none
- **Options:** 2-3 invitations → 1 suggestion → 0 (block)
- **Drift Acknowledgment:** implicit → brief → explicit → named
- **Shift Mention:** casual → available → prominent

**Example Progression:**

```
Minimal Correction (F ~0.70):
  "You mentioned wanting to {purpose}... have you considered...?"

Light Correction (F ~0.65):
  "Your goal was to {purpose}. Maybe we should refocus on..."

Strong Correction (F ~0.55):
  "We seem to have drifted far from {purpose}. 
   I need to redirect to stay aligned."

Block (F < 0.50):
  [Response blocked, human review required]
```

---

### 3.2 Intervention Controller (`intervention_controller.py`)

**Dual-Boundary Control:**

1. **Attractor Pull** (corrective force toward primacy center)
   - Applied when error > ε_min
   - Strength = K × error_signal

2. **Anti-Meta Push** (repel meta-commentary)
   - Applied when meta-commentary detected
   - Uses higher gain (K=2.0)

**Intervention Types:**
- `CONTEXT_INJECTION`: Lightweight reminder injection
- `REGENERATION`: Full response regeneration with constraints
- `HARD_BLOCK`: Immediate block + escalation
- `HUMAN_REVIEW`: Manual intervention required

---

### 3.3 Steward Agent (`unified_steward.py`, `config/steward_pa.py`)

**Specialized AI Agent for Conversation Redirection:**

- **Role:** Therapeutic care alignment (healthcare context)
- **PA:** Separate Primacy Attractor focused on supportive correction
- **Authority:** Gatekeeper (final say in trifecta mode)
- **Capability:** Real-time LLM-based intervention

**Steward Response Characteristics:**
- Acknowledges user's original intent
- Gently redirects to stated purpose
- Offers explicit shift option if appropriate
- Maintains conversational continuity

---

## 4. VALUE ALIGNMENT FEATURES (PRIMACY ATTRACTORS)

### 4.1 Primacy Attractor Design System (`pa_templates.py`)

**Embedding-Space Purpose Representation:**

PA = composite vector from three components:
```
PA = (Purpose + Scope + Boundary) / 3

Purpose: Core intent that governs conversation
Scope:   Specific domains/activities WITHIN the conversation
Boundary: Clear limits on what falls OUTSIDE
```

**Pre-configured Templates (8 major use cases):**

1. **Creative Writing** (write content, craft stories)
   - Scope: Drafting, voice calibration, editing, format adaptation
   - Boundary: NOT research, NOT technical docs, NOT strategic planning

2. **Learn Concept** (understand topics deeply)
   - Scope: Breaking down ideas, analogies, misconceptions, depth progression
   - Boundary: NOT implementing, NOT literature review, NOT planning application

3. **Research Topic** (investigate systematically)
   - Scope: Gathering perspectives, evaluating evidence, synthesizing
   - Boundary: NOT learning concepts, NOT writing polish, NOT advocacy

4. **Code & Technical** (implement and debug)
   - Scope: Architecture decisions, implementation, testing
   - Boundary: NOT documentation, NOT design theory, NOT deployment ops

5. **Planning & Strategy** (organize activities)
   - Scope: Goal definition, resource allocation, timeline/sequencing
   - Boundary: NOT detailed execution, NOT analysis, NOT contingency planning

6. **Analysis & Review** (evaluate existing work)
   - Scope: Critique, performance evaluation, recommendations
   - Boundary: NOT doing the work, NOT planning, NOT rewriting

7. **Brainstorming & Ideation** (generate possibilities)
   - Scope: Novel ideas, combinations, scenario exploration
   - Boundary: NOT evaluation, NOT implementation, NOT commitment

8. **Debugging & Troubleshooting** (fix problems)
   - Scope: Diagnosis, root cause, specific fixes
   - Boundary: NOT architectural redesign, NOT new features, NOT refactoring

**Template Properties:**
- Intent verb maps to AI behavioral role
- Example user queries for training
- Example AI responses demonstrating the role
- Style statement (collaborative partner, teacher, etc.)

**Configurability:**
- Users can create custom PAs
- Mixture parameter τ ∈ [0, 1] controls flexibility
- Domain-specific tuning improves performance (e.g., Healthcare PA)

---

### 4.2 Dual Attractor System (User + AI)

**Location:** `beta_dual_attractor.py`

**Two Fidelity Measurements:**

1. **User PA Fidelity** (F_user)
   - Measures: Is the user staying true to their stated purpose?
   - Input: User's latest message embedding
   - Detects: User drift (off-topic requests)

2. **AI PA Fidelity** (F_AI)
   - Measures: Is the AI staying true to its role?
   - Input: AI's response embedding
   - Detects: AI role violation or hallucination

**Combined Primacy State:**
- Harmonic mean prevents compensation between components
- If either F drops significantly, PS signals alarm
- Enables diagnostic decomposition ("user drifted OR AI went off-role")

---

## 5. TRANSPARENCY & EXPLAINABILITY

### 5.1 TELOSCOPE (Research Instrument) (`teloscope_*.py`)

**Real-Time Governance Visualization:**

**Components:**

1. **Alignment Lens** (Real-time metrics)
   - Current fidelity (0.0-1.0 gauge)
   - Zone classification (color-coded)
   - Intervention tracking (count/type)
   - Primacy State components (F_user, F_AI, ρ_PA)

2. **TELOSCOPE Panel** (Granular view)
   - Fidelity trajectory (grows with each turn)
   - Compact gauge meters for User/AI/Primacy State
   - Integrated Steward chat interface
   - Turn navigation (time-travel through conversation)

3. **Intervention Evidence Dashboard**
   - Each intervention logged with:
     - Type (context injection, regeneration, block)
     - Trigger reason (fidelity level, meta-commentary, etc.)
     - Modification summary
     - Timestamp

4. **Session Summary Generation**
   - AI-powered narrative of governance decisions
   - Self-contained HTML reports
   - Exportable for compliance review

---

### 5.2 Semantic Interpreter (`semantic_interpreter.py`)

**Bridges Mathematical Fidelity → Linguistic Explanation:**

**Function:** `interpret(fidelity: float, purpose: str) -> SemanticSpec`

**Maps Fidelity Levels to Linguistic Features:**

```
Fidelity Score → Strength Calculation → Linguistic Specifications

Example (F=0.65, purpose="Learn ML"):
  Error Signal = 1.0 - 0.65 = 0.35
  Strength = 1.5 × 0.35 = 0.525 (light correction)
  
  Result:
    - Sentence form: "soft statements with question endings"
    - Hedging: light ("maybe", "possibly")
    - Options: 2 suggestions
    - Drift acknowledgment: "brief"
    - Shift mention: True (casual)
    - Purpose reference: "Your goal was to {purpose} -"
```

**Output:** Concrete, measurable linguistic specifications (not vague tone guidance)

## 12. KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

### Current Limitations

1. **Single LLM Input-Output Loop**
   - Not yet adapted for multi-step agentic action chains
   - Phase 1 NSF SBIR research: extending to action trajectories

2. **Embedding-Space Only**
   - Fidelity measured in semantic space
   - Future: Action-space governance for agentic systems

3. **Baseline Establishment**
   - Requires first 3 turns for baseline
   - Could be optimized with faster convergence

### Planned Extensions

1. **Agentic AI Governance** (NSF SBIR Phase I)
   - Tool manifest enforcement
   - Multi-step trajectory tracking
   - Sub-50ms governance overhead

2. **Federated Deployment**
   - Multi-institutional TELOSCOPE testbed
   - Aggregate intelligence layer
   - Privacy-preserving distributed validation

3. **Domain-Specific Tuning**
   - Healthcare PA: Published (8% FPR)
   - Finance PA: In development
   - Legal PA: In development

## CONCLUSION

TELOS implements a governance framework grounded in control engineering mathematics, with empirical validation against NIST AI 600-1 requirements. Key characteristics:

1. **Continuous Measurement:** Fidelity calculated every turn
2. **Proportional Response:** Intervention strength scales with drift magnitude
3. **Forensic Evidence:** Audit trails with cryptographic integrity
4. **Published Validation:** 2,550 adversarial attacks, 0% observed ASR (Rule of Three 95% CI upper bound <0.12%)
5. **Regulatory Alignment:** Mapped to EU AI Act, California SB 53, HIPAA requirements

Production deployment in high-stakes domains (healthcare, finance, government) should follow appropriate validation and calibration for each domain.

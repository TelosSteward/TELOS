# TELOS Observatory: Comprehensive Governance & AI Safety Capabilities Assessment

**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Codebase Version:** v3 (Telically Entrained Linguistic Operational Substrate)  
**Assessment Purpose:** NIST AI 600-1 Framework Compliance  
**Status:** Production-ready with published validation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TELOS is a mathematically grounded governance framework that implements **continuous runtime AI alignment** through embedding-space fidelity measurement, proportional control, and cryptographic audit trails. Unlike static approaches, TELOS treats governance as an ongoing quality control process using statistical methods from manufacturing (Six Sigma, ISO 9001/13485).

**Key Validation Results:**
- **Adversarial Robustness:** 2,550 attacks, 0% attack success rate (95% CI upper bound: ~0.15%)
- **Governance Benchmark:** 46 multi-session evaluations across 8 domains
- **Over-Refusal Calibration:** 8.0% false positive rate (healthcare PA) vs 24.8% (generic PA)
- **Regulatory Alignment:** EU AI Act, California SB 53/243, HIPAA-ready

## 1. GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS

### 1.1 Primacy Attractor (Purpose Definition)

**Location:** `telos_observatory_v3/config/pa_templates.py`, `adaptive_context.py`

**Concept:** User-defined purpose as constitutional "law" in embedding space.

**Structure:**
```
PA = (Purpose Statement + Scope Statement + Boundary Statement) / 3

Purpose:  Core intent governing the conversation
Scope:    Specific domains/activities WITHIN scope
Boundary: Clear limits on what falls OUTSIDE
```

**Pre-configured Templates (8 use cases):**
1. Creative Writing (draft, voice calibration)
2. Learn Concept (understand deeply, break down ideas)
3. Research Topic (investigate systematically)
4. Code & Technical (implement, debug)
5. Planning & Strategy (organize, resource allocation)
6. Analysis & Review (evaluate, recommend)
7. Brainstorming & Ideation (generate possibilities)
8. Debugging & Troubleshooting (diagnose, fix)

**Configurability:**
- Custom PA creation supported
- Mixture parameter τ ∈ [0, 1] controls flexibility
- Domain-specific tuning (healthcare PA proven: 8% FPR)

**Implementation:**
```python
# From pa_templates.py
class PrimacyAttractor:
    purpose_statement: str       # Core intent
    scope_statement: str         # What's IN scope
    boundary_statement: str      # What's OUT of scope
    tau: float = 0.5            # Flexibility parameter (0=rigid, 1=loose)
    rigidity: float = 1.0 - tau # Constraint rigidity
    basin_radius: float = 2.0 / max(rigidity, 0.25)
```

---

### 1.2 Accountability & Audit Trails (Hash Chain)

**Location:** `governance_trace_collector.py`, `evidence_schema.py`

**Cryptographic Hash Chain Implementation:**

```python
# Genesis hash (all zeros)
_last_hash = "0" * 64

# For each event:
event_hash = SHA256(previous_hash + json.dumps(event_data, sorted_keys=True))

# Store in JSONL:
{
    "event_type": "fidelity_calculated",
    "session_id": "...",
    "turn_number": 5,
    "timestamp": "2026-01-29T...",
    "raw_similarity": 0.337,
    "normalized_fidelity": 0.740,
    "fidelity_zone": "green",
    "previous_hash": "abc123...",
    "event_hash": "def456..."  # Hash of all previous content
}
```

**Tamper Detection:**
- Any modification to historical events invalidates all downstream hashes
- Cryptographic proof of integrity for compliance audits
- Reproducible verification (deterministic SHA-256)

**Privacy Modes:**

| Mode | Content | Hashes | Use Case |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **FULL** | Complete data | Included | Regulated environments |
| **HASHED** | SHA-256 only | Computed | Privacy-preserving verification |
| **DELTAS_ONLY** | Metrics only | Excluded | Minimal collection (default) |

**Governance Events (13 types):**

1. SESSION_START - Session initialization
2. PA_ESTABLISHED - Primacy Attractor configured
3. TURN_START - User input received
4. FIDELITY_CALCULATED - Measurement complete
5. INTERVENTION_TRIGGERED - Governance action taken
6. RESPONSE_GENERATED - AI response delivered
7. SSE_TOKEN - Server-sent event token
8. SSE_GOVERNANCE - Real-time governance update
9. TURN_COMPLETE - Turn finalized
10. SESSION_END - Session closed
11. SESSION_SUMMARY - AI-generated narrative
12. **BASELINE_ESTABLISHED** (SAAI) - Drift baseline set
13. **MANDATORY_REVIEW_TRIGGERED** (SAAI) - Escalation event

**Per-Event Fields:**
- Session ID, Turn number, Timestamp (UTC)
- Raw & normalized fidelity scores
- Layer 1 & 2 decision flags
- Distance from PA, basin membership
- Intervention type and rationale
- Previous & current hash

**Published Evidence:**
- 11,208 governance events across 2,550 attacks
- Full forensic traces for every decision
- DOI-cited datasets for reproducibility

---

### 1.3 Policy Implementation

**Location:** `constants.py` (single source of truth)

**Core Thresholds:**

```python
# Layer 1: Baseline Pre-Filter (Extreme Off-Topic)
SIMILARITY_BASELINE = 0.20
  └─ If raw_similarity < 0.20 → HARD_BLOCK

# Layer 2: Basin Membership (Purpose Drift)
BASIN_CENTER = 0.50
BASIN_TOLERANCE = 0.02
INTERVENTION_THRESHOLD = 0.48  # BASIN_CENTER - BASIN_TOLERANCE
  └─ If normalized_fidelity < 0.48 → INTERVENE

# Display Zones (UI Feedback)
FIDELITY_GREEN = 0.70       # Aligned (no action)
FIDELITY_YELLOW = 0.60      # Minor drift (context injection)
FIDELITY_ORANGE = 0.50      # Drift detected (redirect)
FIDELITY_RED = <0.50        # Significant drift (block)
```

**Proportional Control Law:**

```python
F = K × e_t

where:
  K = proportional gain (1.5 default, 2.0 for meta-suppression)
  e_t = normalized error distance (1.0 - current_fidelity)
  F = correction force (capped at 1.0)
```

**Error Thresholds (Scale with constraint tolerance τ):**

```python
ε_min = 0.1 + (0.3 × τ)   # CORRECT state trigger
ε_max = 0.5 + (0.4 × τ)   # INTERVENE state trigger
```

**Intervention Budget:**
```python
MAX_REGENERATIONS = 3              # Per session
INTERVENTION_BUDGET_PER_SESSION = 10  # Soft limit
```

---

## 2. RISK MANAGEMENT FEATURES

### 2.1 Drift Detection & Monitoring

**Location:** `governance_trace_collector.py`, `fidelity_engine.py`

**Two-Layer Detection System:**

**Layer 1: Baseline Pre-Filter**
- Constant: `SIMILARITY_BASELINE = 0.20`
- Raw cosine similarity < 0.20 = extreme off-topic
- Catches content completely outside PA embedding space
- Triggers immediate `HARD_BLOCK`

**Layer 2: Basin Membership Testing**
- Basin center: `BASIN_CENTER = 0.50`
- Intervention threshold: `INTERVENTION_THRESHOLD = 0.48`
- Detects purpose drift through normalized fidelity
- Enables graduated intervention (not binary)

**Per-Turn Monitoring:**

```python
# Fidelity measurement calculated for EVERY turn
fidelity_result = FidelityResult(
    raw_similarity=0.337,           # Direct embedding cosine similarity
    normalized_fidelity=0.740,      # Normalized for display
    layer1_hard_block=False,        # raw < 0.20?
    layer2_outside_basin=False,     # normalized < 0.48?
    zone='green',                   # Display zone
    should_intervene=False          # (raw < 0.20) OR (fidelity < 0.70)
)
```

### 2.2 SAAI Framework Integration (Cumulative Drift)

**Location:** `governance_trace_collector.py` (lines 111-462)

**Safer Agentic AI (SAAI) Framework Implementation:**

Per Dr. Nell Watson's SAAI Framework: "If behavior strays more than 10% away from original programming, triggers mandatory review."

**Three-Phase Process:**

**Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (First N turns)**
```python
BASELINE_TURN_COUNT = 3  # Configurable

# First 3 turns establish "normal operation"
_baseline_fidelities = [0.75, 0.78, 0.76]
_baseline_fidelity = mean([0.75, 0.78, 0.76]) = 0.763

# Event: BaselineEstablishedEvent recorded with:
# - baseline_fidelity: 0.763
# - baseline_min: 0.75, baseline_max: 0.78
# - is_stable: all >= INTERVENTION_THRESHOLD? → True
```

**Phase 2: Drift Computation (After baseline)**
```python
# For each subsequent turn, compute cumulative drift:
drift_magnitude = (baseline_fidelity - current_avg) / baseline_fidelity

Example:
  baseline_fidelity = 0.763
  current_avg (turns 4-10) = 0.68
  drift = (0.763 - 0.68) / 0.763 = 0.109 (10.9%)
```

**Phase 3: Tiered Response (SAAI Thresholds)**

| Threshold | Trigger | Action | Event Type |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **10%** | `SAAI_DRIFT_WARNING` | Mandatory review triggered | `mandatory_review_triggered` |
| **15%** | `SAAI_DRIFT_RESTRICT` | Tighten enforcement thresholds | (threshold adjustment) |
| **20%** | `SAAI_DRIFT_BLOCK` | Halt until human acknowledgment | `mandatory_review_triggered` |

**Implementation:**

```python
def _check_cumulative_drift(self, turn_number: int) -> None:
    """Check for cumulative drift and trigger SAAI tiered response."""
    
    # Phase 1: Check baseline established
    if not self._baseline_established:
        return
    
    # Phase 2: Compute current session average
    current_avg = self._fidelity_sum / self._fidelity_count
    drift_magnitude = (self._baseline_fidelity - current_avg) / self._baseline_fidelity
    
    # Phase 3: Determine drift level
    if drift_magnitude >= SAAI_DRIFT_BLOCK:           # 20%
        new_drift_level = DriftLevel.BLOCK
    elif drift_magnitude >= SAAI_DRIFT_RESTRICT:      # 15%
        new_drift_level = DriftLevel.RESTRICT
    elif drift_magnitude >= SAAI_DRIFT_WARNING:       # 10%
        new_drift_level = DriftLevel.WARNING
    
    # Trigger review if escalating
    if self._should_trigger_review(new_drift_level):
        self._trigger_mandatory_review(...)
        logger.warning(f"SAAI MANDATORY REVIEW: {new_drift_level}, drift={drift_magnitude:.1%}")
```

**MandatoryReviewTriggeredEvent Fields:**
```python
{
    "event_type": "mandatory_review_triggered",
    "drift_level": "restrict",              # DriftLevel enum
    "drift_magnitude": 0.158,               # 15.8%
    "baseline_fidelity": 0.763,
    "current_average": 0.644,
    "threshold_crossed": 0.15,              # SAAI_DRIFT_RESTRICT
    "action_taken": "thresholds_tightened",
    "requires_acknowledgment": False,       # True only for BLOCK level
}
```

---

### 2.3 Adaptive Context (False Positive Reduction)

**Location:** `adaptive_context.py`

**Multi-Turn Fidelity Adjustment System:**

**Problem Solved:**
- Short follow-up messages like "Yes, show me an example" have low direct PA similarity (~0.32)
- But semantically they're clearly continuation of the conversation
- Without context awareness, would trigger false-positive drift detection

**Solution: Multi-Tier Context Buffer**

```python
# Tier 1: High fidelity messages (≥0.70) - 5 messages, weight 0.6
# Tier 2: Medium fidelity (0.35-0.70) - 3 messages, weight 0.3
# Tier 3: Low fidelity (0.25-0.35) - 2 messages, weight 0.1
# Below 0.25: Not stored (too off-topic)

class MultiTierContextBuffer:
    tier1: deque(maxlen=5)      # High fidelity
    tier2: deque(maxlen=3)      # Medium fidelity
    tier3: deque(maxlen=2)      # Low fidelity
    ai_response_buffer: deque(maxlen=5)  # Recent AI responses
```

**Semantic Continuity Inheritance (SCI v4.0):**

Instead of arbitrary syntax-based boosts, TELOS MEASURES semantic continuity:

```python
# Calculate similarity between current message and previous turn
previous_turn_embeddings = [user_query_embedding, ai_response_embedding]
continuity_score = max(cosine_similarity(current_input, prev) for prev in previous_turn_embeddings)

# Thresholds for inheritance
SCI_STRONG_CONTINUITY = 0.70    # Nearly full inheritance (0.99 decay)
SCI_MODERATE_CONTINUITY = 0.50  # Standard decay (0.95)
SCI_WEAK_CONTINUITY = 0.30      # Noticeable decay (0.90)

# Example: "Yes, show me an example"
# - Direct PA similarity: ~0.32 (low)
# - Continuity to previous recursion turn: ~0.65 (high)
# - Inherit previous fidelity (0.78) × 0.95 decay = 0.741
# - Use max(direct, inherited) = 0.741 instead of 0.32
```

**Conversation Phase Detection:**

```python
class ConversationPhase(Enum):
    EXPLORATION = "exploration"   # Early turns, discovering purpose
    FOCUS = "focus"               # Established topic, stable fidelity
    DRIFT = "drift"               # Declining fidelity trend
    RECOVERY = "recovery"         # Rising fidelity after drift

# Phase-specific threshold modifiers
PHASE_MODIFIERS = {
    ConversationPhase.EXPLORATION: -0.10,  # More lenient
    ConversationPhase.FOCUS: 0.0,          # Standard
    ConversationPhase.DRIFT: 0.10,         # Stricter (no boost)
    ConversationPhase.RECOVERY: -0.05,     # Slightly lenient
}
```

**Context Attractor (MAX Similarity, not Centroid):**

```python
# Instead of centroid averaging embeddings:
# centroid_sim = mean(similarities) = 0.381  # Weak signal

# Use MAX similarity to any high-fidelity prior turn:
# max_sim = max(similarities) = 0.492  # Stronger signal

# Type-aware thresholds for boost:
MESSAGE_TYPE_THRESHOLDS = {
    MessageType.ANAPHORA: 0.15,      # "that", "it", "this"
    MessageType.CLARIFICATION: 0.20, # Questions about prior content
    MessageType.FOLLOW_UP: 0.20,     # Syntactic continuation
    MessageType.DIRECT: 0.35,        # New topic statements
}

# Type-aware multipliers:
MESSAGE_TYPE_MULTIPLIERS = {
    MessageType.ANAPHORA: 1.5,       # Strongest pull
    MessageType.CLARIFICATION: 1.4,
    MessageType.FOLLOW_UP: 1.0,
    MessageType.DIRECT: 0.7,
}
```

---

## 3. HUMAN OVERSIGHT CAPABILITIES

### 3.1 Graduated Intervention System

**Location:** `semantic_interpreter.py`, `intervention_controller.py`

**Four-State Cascade (Proportional to Risk):**

```
State 1: MONITOR (F ≥ 0.76)
  └─ No action needed
  └─ Conversation aligned with purpose

State 2: CORRECT (0.73 ≤ F < 0.76)
  └─ Context injection (lightweight)
  └─ Hedged language, implicit acknowledgment
  └─ Example: "You mentioned wanting to {purpose}... have you considered...?"

State 3: INTERVENE (0.67 ≤ F < 0.73)
  └─ Steward redirect with constraints
  └─ Regeneration or guided conversation
  └─ Example: "We seem to have drifted from {purpose}. Let me refocus..."

State 4: ESCALATE (F < 0.67 OR SAAI BLOCK)
  └─ Block response
  └─ Require human review
  └─ SAAI thresholds: 10% (warning), 15% (restrict), 20% (block)
```

**Linguistic Specification Scaling:**

The `SemanticInterpreter` maps fidelity to concrete linguistic features:

```python
class SemanticSpec:
    sentence_form: str          # "questions" → "directives"
    hedging: str               # "heavy" (might) → "light" (maybe) → "none"
    options_offered: int       # 2-3 → 1 → 0
    drift_acknowledgment: str  # "implicit" → "brief" → "explicit"
    shift_mention: str         # "casual" → "available" → "prominent"
    purpose_reference: str     # Template with {purpose}
```

**Example Progression (Fidelity Decline):**

```
F = 0.70 (Minimal correction):
  "You mentioned wanting to build a governance framework... 
   have you considered what metrics matter most?"

F = 0.65 (Light correction):
  "Your goal was to build a governance framework. 
   Maybe we should refocus on the core problem statement?"

F = 0.55 (Strong correction):
  "We seem to have drifted far from building your governance framework. 
   I need to redirect to stay aligned with your stated purpose."

F < 0.50 (Block):
  [Response blocked. Human review required.]
```

**Correction Strength Formula:**

```python
strength = K × error_signal
where:
  K = 1.5 (standard), 2.0 (meta-suppression)
  error_signal = 1.0 - current_fidelity
  
Example (F = 0.65):
  error_signal = 1.0 - 0.65 = 0.35
  strength = 1.5 × 0.35 = 0.525  # Light correction
```

### 3.2 Steward Agent (Specialized Intervention)

**Location:** `unified_steward.py`, `config/steward_pa.py`

**Role:** Therapeutic care alignment (healthcare-specific LLM agent)

**Characteristics:**
- Separate Primacy Attractor focused on supportive correction
- Gatekeeper authority (final say in trifecta governance mode)
- Real-time LLM-based intervention
- Conversational continuity maintained

**Intervention Types:**

```python
class InterventionType(Enum):
    CONTEXT_INJECTION = "context_injection"  # Lightweight reminder
    REGENERATION = "regeneration"           # Full response redo
    HARD_BLOCK = "hard_block"              # Immediate block
    HUMAN_REVIEW = "human_review"          # Manual intervention
```

### 3.3 Fidelity Tracking & Visualization

**Location:** `components/` (27 Streamlit UI components)

**TELOSCOPE (Research Instrument):**

Real-time governance visualization with 4 components:

1. **Alignment Lens** (Real-time metrics)
   - Current fidelity gauge (0.0-1.0)
   - Zone classification (GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED)
   - Intervention count and types
   - Primacy State components (F_user, F_AI, ρ_PA)

2. **TELOSCOPE Panel** (Granular view)
   - Fidelity trajectory over turns
   - Compact gauge meters
   - Integrated Steward chat
   - Turn navigation (time-travel)

3. **Intervention Evidence Dashboard**
   - Per-intervention logged with:
     - Type, Trigger reason, Modification summary, Timestamp

4. **Session Summary** (AI-generated narrative)
   - Exported as self-contained HTML reports
   - Compliance-ready documentation

---

## 4. SECURITY & SAFETY GUARDRAILS

### 4.1 Meta-Commentary Suppression

**Location:** `constants.py`, `proportional_controller.py`

**Detection Patterns:**

```python
META_COMMENTARY_PATTERNS = [
    r'\bmy purpose is\b',
    r'\bmy constraints\b',
    r'\bi am designed to\b',
    r'\bmy guardrails\b',
    r'\baccording to my instructions\b',
    r'\bas an ai language model\b',
    r'\bas a large language model\b'
]
```

**Suppression Mechanism:**
- Higher proportional gain: `K_ANTIMETA = 2.0` (vs 1.5 default)
- Prepends context injection or applies regeneration
- Prevents model from discussing its own governance

### 4.2 Dual Attractor System (User + AI Fidelity)

**Location:** `beta_dual_attractor.py`

**Two Independent Measurements:**

```python
F_user = fidelity(user_input, PA)     # User staying on purpose?
F_AI = fidelity(ai_response, PA)      # AI staying in role?

# Combined via harmonic mean (prevents compensation):
PS = ρ_PA × (2 × F_user × F_AI) / (F_user + F_AI)
```

**Enables Diagnostic Decomposition:**
- User drifted OR AI went off-role?
- Prevents one component masking failure in another

### 4.3 Governance Decision Hierarchy

**Location:** `fidelity_gate.py`, `fidelity_engine.py`

**Graduated Decisions (Gateway API):**

```python
class GovernanceDecision(Enum):
    EXECUTE = "execute"      # fidelity ≥ 0.45 - All systems go
    CLARIFY = "clarify"      # 0.35-0.45 - Need more context
    SUGGEST = "suggest"      # 0.25-0.35 - Consider alternatives
    INERT = "inert"          # < 0.25 - Silent block (no reveal)
    ESCALATE = "escalate"    # SAAI drift BLOCK level
```

**Multi-Tool Fidelity Evaluation:**

For agents with multiple tools, TELOS computes:
1. Input fidelity (user query vs PA)
2. Tool descriptions against PA
3. Tool invocation correctness
4. **Minimum tool fidelity triggers intervention** (weakest link principle)

---

## 5. TRACEABILITY FEATURES

### 5.1 Hash Chain Implementation

**Location:** `governance_trace_collector.py` (lines 813-852)

**Per-Event Hash Calculation:**

```python
def _write_event(self, event: GovernanceEvent) -> None:
    """Write event with cryptographic hash chain."""
    
    # Serialize to JSON
    event_json = serialize_event(event)
    event_dict = json.loads(event_json)
    
    # Add previous hash
    event_dict["previous_hash"] = self._last_hash
    
    # Compute current event hash
    hash_content = self._last_hash + json.dumps(event_dict, sort_keys=True)
    event_hash = hashlib.sha256(hash_content.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    event_dict["event_hash"] = event_hash
    
    # Update for next event
    self._last_hash = event_hash
    
    # Write to JSONL
    with open(self.trace_file, 'a') as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(event_dict) + '\n')
```

**Tamper Verification:**

```python
# To verify integrity:
# 1. Read all events in order
# 2. Recompute each hash: SHA256(prev_hash + content)
# 3. Compare recomputed hash with stored event_hash
# 4. If any mismatch, chain is broken at that point
```

### 5.2 JSONL Format & Log Aggregation

**Location:** `governance_traces/` directory

**File Naming:**
```
session_{session_id}_{timestamp}.jsonl

Example:
session_abc123_20260129_143022.jsonl
```

**Format (Newline-delimited JSON):**

```json
{"event_type": "session_start", "session_id": "abc123", "timestamp": "2026-01-29T14:30:22Z", "privacy_mode": "deltas_only", ...}
{"event_type": "pa_established", "session_id": "abc123", "pa_template": "healthcare", "purpose_statement": "Provide evidence-based medical information", ...}
{"event_type": "baseline_established", "session_id": "abc123", "baseline_fidelity": 0.763, "baseline_turn_count": 3, ...}
{"event_type": "fidelity_calculated", "session_id": "abc123", "turn_number": 4, "raw_similarity": 0.68, "normalized_fidelity": 0.704, ...}
{"event_type": "turn_complete", "session_id": "abc123", "turn_number": 4, "final_fidelity": 0.704, "intervention_applied": false, ...}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Elasticsearch (bulk ingestion)
- Splunk (real-time search)
- CloudWatch (AWS monitoring)
- Supabase (structured queries)

## 6. TELOS PRINCIPLES & PURPOSE DOCUMENTATION

### 6.1 Core Philosophy

**From TELOS_Whitepaper_v2.5.md:**

TELOS treats AI governance as a **quality control process**, not a one-time training task.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Measurement-Based:** Fidelity calculated every turn, not quarterly audits
2. **Proportional Response:** Intervention scales with risk, not binary pass/fail
3. **Transparent Decision-Making:** All governance decisions logged and auditable
4. **Regulatory Alignment:** Built for EU AI Act, California SB 53, HIPAA
5. **Open Research:** All governance research published, no "too dangerous to share" exceptions

### 6.2 Ten Founding Principles (TELOS Consortium)

From `TELOS_Whitepaper_v2.5.md` (Section 0.5):

1. All governance research should be published openly
2. All governance claims should be validated with evidence
3. All governance decisions should be made transparently
4. Commercial sustainability should fund, not limit, research
5. Academic independence should verify, not just approve, findings
6. Practitioners should inform, not simply use, research
7. Regulators should have access to validated, reproducible frameworks
8. Failures should be discussed publicly, not kept secret
9. Competing implementations should be encouraged, not silenced
10. Trust should be built through transparency, not demanded through authority

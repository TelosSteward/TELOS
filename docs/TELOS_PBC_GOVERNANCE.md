# TELOS AI Labs Governance Framework
## C-Corp to Public Benefit Corporation Conversion Roadmap

**Status**: Active Planning Document
**Current Entity**: Delaware C-Corporation (incorporated December 2025)
**Target Entity**: Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (contingent on funding + consortium formation)
**Date**: December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

TELOS AI Labs is incorporated as a Delaware C-Corporation to enable rapid execution during the early-stage, pre-funding period. This document outlines our intended conversion to a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) upon securing significant grant funding and establishing institutional consortium partners.

**Why start as C-Corp:**
- Fastest path to incorporation for solo founder
- Standard structure familiar to all stakeholders
- No benefit reporting obligations during unfunded period
- Delaware allows straightforward C-Corp → PBC conversion

**Why convert to PBC:**
- Explicit public benefit purpose in charter
- Fiduciary duty to stakeholders beyond shareholders
- Legal protection for mission-first decisions
- Acquisition protection (benefit purpose survives)
- Enhanced grant eligibility (many foundations prefer PBCs)

---

## 1. Current State: C-Corporation

### 1.1 Entity Details

**TELOS AI Labs, Inc.** - Delaware C-Corporation

- **Status**: Incorporated December 2025
- **Jurisdiction**: Delaware
- **EIN**: 41-3192389
- **Structure**: Single founder/director, standard certificate of incorporation
- **Flexibility**: Positioned to pursue grants, customers, and partnerships

### 1.2 Mission Commitment (Pre-PBC)

While operating as a C-Corp, TELOS Labs voluntarily commits to the principles that will later be enshrined in our PBC charter:

1. **Open Research**: Core governance mathematics published openly under Apache 2.0
2. **Transparency**: Validation methodology and results publicly available
3. **Mission Priority**: Building governance-native AI infrastructure, not maximizing short-term profit
4. **Stakeholder Consideration**: Decisions consider research community, users, and public benefit

These commitments are currently contractual and voluntary. PBC conversion makes them legally binding.

---

## 2. Conversion Trigger: Funding + Consortium Partners

### 2.1 Conversion Criteria

TELOS Labs will convert from C-Corp to PBC when **both** conditions are met:

| Criterion | Threshold | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Funding Secured** | $500K+ cumulative | Resources to support governance overhead, benefit reporting |
| **Consortium Partners** | 2+ institutional commitments | Legitimate consortium to occupy board seat |

### 2.2 Why Both Criteria?

**Funding alone is insufficient:** PBC structure includes consortium board seat with veto rights. Without actual consortium partners, this seat would be empty or symbolic—undermining the governance model's integrity.

**Partners alone are insufficient:** Benefit reporting and governance overhead require resources. Unfunded PBC with consortium obligations would strain operations.

### 2.3 Conversion Mechanism

Delaware Code Title 8, § 363 permits C-Corp to PBC conversion via:
1. Board resolution approving amendment to certificate of incorporation
2. Stockholder approval (majority of outstanding stock)
3. Filing amended certificate with Delaware Secretary of State

For single-founder company, this is straightforward: founder approves as sole director and sole stockholder.

---

## 3. Target PBC Structure

### 3.1 Proposed Public Benefit Purpose

Upon conversion, the certificate of incorporation will include:

**Specific Public Benefit** (Delaware Code Title 8, § 362):

> "The specific public benefit purpose of TELOS AI Labs, PBC is to advance the development, validation, and deployment of open, transparent, and empirically validated AI governance frameworks that:
>
> (a) Preserve meaningful human authority over artificial intelligence systems;
>
> (b) Enable continuous, quantitative measurement of AI alignment during deployment;
>
> (c) Provide the technical infrastructure required for regulatory compliance with AI governance frameworks including but not limited to the EU AI Act and California AI regulations;
>
> (d) Publish all core governance research openly for independent validation, reproducibility, and public benefit;
>
> (e) Operate in coordination with the TELOS Consortium to ensure research independence and academic validation.
>
> The Corporation shall balance the pecuniary interests of stockholders with the best interests of those materially affected by the Corporation's conduct, and shall pursue the specific public benefit purpose identified above."

### 3.2 Benefit Report Requirements

Post-conversion, TELOS Labs commits to annual reporting on:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Research Published** | Papers, frameworks, benchmarks released openly |
| **Deployments Active** | Production governance systems in operation |
| **Harm Prevention** | Documented drift catches, intervention events |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Certifications achieved, audits passed |
| **Consortium Coordination** | Joint research, data sharing, academic validation |

---

## 8. Investment Compatibility

### 8.1 C-Corp Phase (Current)

Standard venture investment terms apply during C-Corp phase. Investors should be informed of intended PBC conversion and associated governance changes.

### 8.2 PBC Phase (Post-Conversion)

Delaware PBC allows standard venture investment with modifications:

| Standard VC Term | PBC Modification |
|------------------|------------------|
| Board seats | Subject to Consortium seat protection |
| Protective provisions | Cannot override Consortium consent rights |
| Exit rights | Acquirer must accept public benefit purpose |
| Information rights | Standard, no conflict with Consortium |
| Anti-dilution | Standard |
| Liquidation preference | Standard |

### 8.3 Investor Alignment

Target investors who understand and value PBC structure:
- Omidyar Network
- Obvious Ventures
- Kapor Capital
- DBL Partners
- Mission-aligned family offices
- AI safety-focused funders

### 8.4 Grant Compatibility

PBC structure enhances grant eligibility:
- Many foundations prefer PBCs
- Public benefit purpose aligns with grant objectives
- Open research commitment satisfies open-access requirements
- Consortium relationship provides academic validation

---

## 9. Acquisition Provisions (Post-Conversion)

### 9.1 Benefit Purpose Continuity

Any acquisition must:

1. **Acquirer commits** to continuing public benefit purpose for minimum 3 years
2. **Open research** commitment continues (cannot close previously open work)
3. **Consortium relationship** preserved or successor arrangement established
4. **Consortium designee** approves acquisition terms (per Section 6.1)

### 9.2 Hostile Takeover Protection

Consortium consent requirement provides natural defense:
- Acquirer cannot eliminate open research commitment without consent
- Consortium can block acquisitions that would close research
- Protects mission even if majority of stockholders favor sale

### 9.3 Friendly Acquisition

Mission-aligned acquisitions (e.g., Anthropic, safety-focused company) would:
- Negotiate Consortium consent
- Commit to continuing open research
- Potentially expand resources for mission
- Consortium evaluates acquirer's commitment and track record

---

## 10. Founder Commitments

### 10.1 Personal Commitments

Founders commit to:

1. **Mission Priority**: Public benefit purpose guides all major decisions
2. **Open Research**: Personal advocacy for publication and transparency
3. **Consortium Independence**: Respect research independence, no editorial interference
4. **Long-term View**: Build for sustainable impact, not quick exit
5. **Stakeholder Balance**: Consider employees, users, research community, not just investors

### 10.2 Equity Vesting

Founder equity vests over 4 years with:
- 1-year cliff
- Monthly vesting thereafter
- Accelerated vesting on mission-aligned acquisition
- **Mission clawback**: Unvested equity forfeit if founder takes actions materially contrary to public benefit purpose

## 12. Messaging by Audience

### For Grant Applications

> "TELOS AI Labs is a Delaware corporation pursuing open AI governance research. Upon securing funding and establishing institutional consortium partners, we will convert to a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation with a board seat reserved for consortium representation. The governance framework is documented and ready to activate—this grant would help us reach that threshold."

### For Investors

> "We're currently a Delaware C-Corp, the standard structure for early-stage ventures. Our roadmap includes conversion to a PBC once we have the resources and partners to implement our governance model properly. This protects mission while enabling growth—the consortium seat and protective provisions activate at scale, ensuring alignment survives success."

### For Academic Partners

> "We're building toward a formal consortium structure where academic institutions have governance representation in the commercial entity. Your early involvement as a founding partner positions you for that board seat when we convert to PBC. The framework is documented; we're seeking the funding and partnerships to make it real."

### The Honest Position

We are not pretending to have a PBC or consortium today. We are:
1. A solo founder with a working platform and a C-Corp
2. A vision for how this should scale
3. Governance documents ready to activate
4. Seeking funding and partners to make the conversion viable

The PBC structure described in this document is **what we're building toward**, contingent on funding and consortium partners. We're establishing the framework early because we expect this trajectory is inevitable—runtime AI governance will require exactly this kind of open, accountable structure.

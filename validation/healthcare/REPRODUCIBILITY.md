### Disclosures

> **Generative AI Disclosure:** Internal analysis, experimental design review, and qualitative assessment in this document were conducted with assistance from LLM-based research agents (Claude, Anthropic). These agents are prompted with domain-specific personas (governance theory, statistics, systems engineering, regulatory analysis, research methodology) and operate as AI research assistants — not independent human expert reviewers. All quantitative results (AUC-ROC, F1, bootstrap confidence intervals, benchmark accuracies) are computed by deterministic code. Qualitative analysis should not be treated as independent peer review. See `research/research_team_spec.md` for full methodology.

> **Conflict of Interest Disclosure:** This research was conducted and funded by TELOS AI Labs Inc., which has a commercial interest in the TELOS governance framework. All domain-specific validation benchmarks (Nearmap, Healthcare, OpenClaw) were created by the research team. External benchmarks (PropensityBench, AgentHarm, AgentDojo) were created by independent organizations. Research artifacts are published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with persistent DOIs. No external funding or independent peer review was involved in this work.

## What This Benchmark Does

This is a **Phase I multi-config mechanism validation** benchmark. It tests whether the TELOS governance math — cosine-similarity fidelity scoring, boundary detection, and drift tracking — correctly differentiates between legitimate clinical requests, scope violations, boundary violations, adversarial attacks, and off-topic noise **across 7 distinct healthcare AI agent configurations**.

The benchmark dynamically loads 7 healthcare agent configurations from `templates/healthcare/*.yaml`, each with its own purpose, scope, tools, and boundaries. Each scenario specifies a `config_id` field that determines which agent configuration the governance engine evaluates the request against. This tests a critical production requirement: a governance engine deployed in a health system must correctly govern fundamentally different clinical AI agents simultaneously.

The benchmark tests five governance dimensions per configuration:
- **Purpose fidelity** — Is this request aligned with this agent's purpose?
- **Scope fidelity** — Is this within this agent's authorized scope?
- **Tool fidelity** — Which of this agent's tools best fits this request?
- **Boundary fidelity** — Does this request violate any of this agent's hard boundaries?
- **Chain continuity (SCI)** — Does this action follow logically from the previous one?

It also validates:
- **SAAI drift detection** across multi-step sequences (NORMAL -> WARNING -> RESTRICT -> BLOCK)
- **Adversarial robustness** against 12 healthcare-specific attack families mapped to OWASP/NIST
- **Cross-config accuracy** — Does the engine maintain precision when switching between agents?
- **No-governance control condition** — Quantifies the value added by governance vs. naive pass-through

**No API keys, no network access, no proprietary data, no patient data required.**

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- ~500MB disk space (for sentence-transformers model download on first run)
- No GPU required (CPU inference only)

### Python Dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages used by the benchmark:
- `sentence-transformers` — Local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim)
- `numpy` — Vector math
- `pyyaml` — YAML config loading for 7 healthcare templates
- `pytest` — Test runner

**No API keys needed.** The benchmark uses a local sentence-transformer model. LLM responses are disabled (deterministic template fallback).

## Running the Benchmark

### Quick Run (CLI)

```bash
# From project root
cd /path/to/telos

# Basic run (all 7 configs)
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py

# Verbose (per-scenario pass/fail with config labels)
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py -v

# With forensic report generation (HTML + JSONL + CSV)
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --forensic -v

# Filter to a single config
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --config healthcare_coding -v
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --config healthcare_diagnostic_ai -v

# Custom output locations
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py \
    --output results.json \
    --forensic \
    --forensic-dir ./my_reports/
```

### TELOS CLI Integration

```bash
# Run via the TELOS CLI (if installed)
telos benchmark run -b healthcare --forensic -v
```

### No-Governance Control Condition

The `--no-governance` flag bypasses all governance scoring and always returns EXECUTE for every scenario. This serves as the null hypothesis control — it quantifies what happens when clinical AI agents operate without governance oversight.

```bash
# Run without governance (control condition)
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --no-governance -v
```

In the no-governance condition:
- Every scenario receives decision=EXECUTE regardless of content
- All fidelity scores are set to 1.0 (perfect)
- Boundary detection is disabled
- Drift tracking is disabled

This means adversarial attacks (PHI exfiltration, billing fraud, EMTALA bypass, clinical hallucination) would all proceed to tool execution. The delta between governed and ungoverned accuracy quantifies the governance engine's value.

### pytest Integration

```bash
# Run healthcare benchmark tests
pytest tests/validation/test_healthcare_benchmark.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/validation/test_healthcare_benchmark.py::TestAdversarialRobustness -v
pytest tests/validation/test_healthcare_benchmark.py::TestCrossConfigAccuracy -v

# Run full test suite (all benchmarks)
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Embedding Model

The benchmark uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings). This model is:
- **Local** — No API calls, no network access during benchmark
- **Deterministic** — Same input always produces identical embeddings
- **Version-pinnable** — Frozen model weights ensure reproducibility across machines
- **Fast** — ~315 scenarios across 7 configs scored in ~45-90 seconds on CPU

The model is downloaded automatically on first run (~80MB) and cached in `~/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/`.

### Model Version Pinning

For exact reproducibility, the benchmark was validated against:
- **Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Hugging Face revision:** `c5e0feb76a64bc391ec36b4f46f4c74ab2ce4dcb`
- **sentence-transformers version:** see `requirements.lock` for exact version

To pin the exact model revision:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2", revision="c5e0feb76a64bc391ec36b4f46f4c74ab2ce4dcb")
```

### Threshold System

Because MiniLM produces 384-dim embeddings (vs Mistral's 1024-dim), cosine similarities are lower. The TELOS engine uses model-appropriate thresholds:

| Decision | Mistral (1024-dim) | SentenceTransformer (384-dim) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| EXECUTE | >= 0.85 | >= 0.45 |
| CLARIFY | >= 0.70 | >= 0.35 |
| ESCALATE | < 0.70 + boundary/risk | < 0.35 + boundary/risk |
| RESTRICT tightening | 0.90 | 0.52 |

---

## Reproducing from Scratch

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TELOS-Labs-AI/telos.git
cd telos
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the benchmark

```bash
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --forensic -v
```

Or via the TELOS CLI:

```bash
telos benchmark run -b healthcare --forensic -v
```

### Step 4: Run the no-governance control

```bash
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --no-governance -v
```

Compare the governed vs. ungoverned results to quantify governance value. In the ungoverned condition, every adversarial scenario (PHI exfiltration, billing fraud, EMTALA bypass, hallucination prompting) receives EXECUTE — the governance engine's improvement over this baseline is the core measurement.

### Step 5: Run per-config validation

```bash
# Validate each config independently
for config in healthcare_ambient_doc healthcare_call_center healthcare_coding \
              healthcare_diagnostic_ai healthcare_patient_facing \
              healthcare_predictive healthcare_therapeutic; do
    echo "=== $config ==="
    python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --config $config -v
done
```

### Step 6: Run the test suite

```bash
pytest tests/validation/test_healthcare_benchmark.py -v
```

### Step 7: Inspect the forensic report

```bash
open validation/healthcare/reports/healthcare_benchmark_forensic_*.html
```

### Verifying Determinism

Run the benchmark twice and compare:

```bash
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --output run1.json
python3 validation/healthcare/run_healthcare_benchmark.py --output run2.json

# Compare (timestamps will differ, governance telemetry should be identical)
python3 -c "
import json
with open('run1.json') as f: r1 = json.load(f)
with open('run2.json') as f: r2 = json.load(f)
mismatches = 0
for s1, s2 in zip(r1['scenario_results'], r2['scenario_results']):
    if s1['governance_telemetry'] != s2['governance_telemetry']:
        print(f'MISMATCH: {s1[\"scenario_id\"]}')
        mismatches += 1
if mismatches == 0:
    print(f'All {len(r1[\"scenario_results\"])} scenario telemetry records identical across runs.')
else:
    print(f'{mismatches} mismatches found — check model version pinning.')
"
```

**Why determinism is guaranteed:** The benchmark uses a local sentence-transformer model with fixed weights. No API calls are made. No randomness is introduced (no dropout, no sampling). LLM responses are disabled (deterministic template fallback). The same input always produces the same embedding, the same cosine similarity, and the same governance decision.

## 1. Benchmark Methodology: HarmBench

**Citation:** Mazeika, M., et al. (2024). "HarmBench: A Standardized Evaluation Framework for Automated Red Teaming and Robust Refusal." *arXiv:2402.04249*

### Key Methodology Points

- **Attack Methods Tested:** 18 distinct red-teaming approaches including:
  - GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) - Zou et al., 2023
  - PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) - Chao et al., 2023
  - TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning) - Mehrotra et al., 2023
  - AutoDAN - Liu et al., 2023
  - Human jailbreaks collected from online sources

- **Models Evaluated:** 33 LLMs including GPT-4, Claude 2, Llama 2, Mistral, Vicuna

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR) Definition:**
  > "We define the attack success rate (ASR) as the fraction of test cases for which at least one attack successfully elicits the target behavior" (Mazeika et al., 2024, Section 3.2)

- **Evaluation Method:** Llama 2 13B fine-tuned classifier for automated assessment

- **Reported Results (Table 3, Mazeika et al.):**
  | Model | Direct Request ASR | Best Attack ASR |
  |-------|-------------------|-----------------|
  | GPT-4 | 1.0% | 38.8% (TAP) |
  | Claude 2 | 0.0% | 12.8% (Human) |
  | Llama 2 7B | 0.0% | 43.4% (GCG) |

## 2. Adaptive Jailbreak Attacks

**Citation:** Andriushchenko, M., et al. (2024). "Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks." *arXiv:2404.02151*

### Key Findings

- **Attack Methods:**
  - Random search on adversarial suffixes
  - Prefilling attacks (for models that allow assistant prefilling)
  - Transfer attacks using surrogate models

- **Critical Result (Abstract):**
  > "We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. We run an extensive red-teaming study to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve nearly 100% attack success rate on GPT-4 and Claude models..."

- **Specific Results (Table 1):**
  | Model | Attack Success Rate |
  |-------|-------------------|
  | GPT-4o | 86% (random search) |
  | GPT-4o-mini | 100% (random search) |
  | Claude 3 Opus | 47% (prefilling) |
  | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 64% (prefilling) |

- **Evaluation:** GPT-4 as judge with StrongREJECT rubric (Souly et al., 2024)

## 3. Fundamental RLHF Safety Training Limitations

**Citation:** Wei, A., Haghtalab, N., & Steinhardt, J. (2024). "Jailbroken: How Does LLM Safety Training Fail?" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*, 36. arXiv:2307.02483

### Two Failure Modes Identified

**1. Competing Objectives:**
> "The first failure mode, competing objectives, arises when the model's capabilities conflict with its safety goals. For example, a model trained to be helpful may also want to avoid refusing user requests..."

**2. Mismatched Generalization:**
> "The second failure mode, mismatched generalization, occurs when safety training does not generalize to inputs outside the training distribution, while capabilities do..."

### Specific Attack Categories Exploiting These Failures:
- Prefix injection
- Refusal suppression
- Base64 encoding (mismatched generalization)
- Low-resource language prompts
- Roleplay scenarios

### Key Theoretical Insight:
> "Safety training creates a thin shell of refusal behavior that can be punctured by sufficiently novel attacks, while the underlying capabilities remain intact."

## 4. Embedding Space Attacks

**Citation:** Schwinn, L., et al. (2024). "Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space." *arXiv:2402.09063*

### Key Finding:
> "Attacks in the continuous embedding space can circumvent safety alignment more efficiently than discrete token-based attacks."

### Mechanism:
- Direct manipulation of soft prompt embeddings
- Bypasses discrete token safety filters
- Achieves higher ASR with fewer optimization steps than GCG

### Implications:
- Safety training at the token level may not protect against embedding-level manipulations
- Models remain vulnerable even when trained with adversarial examples at the token level

## 5. Representation Engineering Approaches

**Citation:** Sheshadri, A., et al. (2024). "Targeted Latent Adversarial Training Improves Robustness to Persistent Harmful Behaviors in LLMs." *arXiv:2407.15549*

**Citation:** Zou, A., et al. (2024). "Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency." *arXiv:2310.01405*

### RepBend Results:
> "RepBend achieves up to 95% improvement in reducing ASR compared to standard safety training while maintaining model utility."

### Circuit Breakers (Zou et al.):
- Activation steering to redirect harmful behavior
- Works at representation level rather than output level
- Achieves partial robustness but not complete blocking

## 6. MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark (v0.5)

**Citation:** MLCommons AI Safety Working Group. (2024). "AI Safety Benchmark v0.5." MLCommons.

### Methodology:
- **Prompt Count:** 24,000+ hazard prompts
- **Categories:** 12 hazard taxonomy categories including:
  - Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)
  - Suicide and self-harm
  - Weapons and violence
  - Hate speech

- **Grading System:** 5-tier scale (1-5) based on response safety
- **Focus:** Holistic safety evaluation across diverse harm vectors

## 8. Architectural Distinction

### RLHF-Based Safety (Current Industry Standard):
Per Wei et al. (2024), RLHF safety training operates by:
1. Fine-tuning on refusal demonstrations
2. Training preference models to avoid harmful outputs
3. Applying the trained preferences at inference time

**Limitations (Wei et al.):**
- Creates "thin shell" of refusal behavior
- Vulnerable to competing objectives exploitation
- Fails on out-of-distribution attacks (mismatched generalization)

### TELOS Geometric Approach:
1. Defines user purpose as embedding-space attractor (Primacy Attractor)
2. Computes real-time fidelity as cosine similarity between input and PA
3. Applies graduated intervention based on geometric distance from purpose
4. Escalates to human expert when detection confidence is low

**Key Distinction:**
TELOS does not attempt to train away harmful behaviors. Instead, it defines what is *allowed* (the PA) and measures deviation from that defined purpose. This inverts the problem from "block all harmful things" to "only permit purpose-aligned things."

## 9. Research Implications

### What the Data Shows:

1. **RLHF vulnerability is documented:** Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that RLHF safety training fails against adaptive attacks (Andriushchenko et al., Wei et al.)

2. **Embedding-space attacks are effective:** Schwinn et al. show that operating in embedding space bypasses token-level safety measures

3. **TELOS operates in embedding space for governance:** By computing fidelity in the same embedding space where attacks can operate, TELOS addresses the attack surface directly

4. **100% defense requires human escalation:** TELOS achieves 0% ASR through a combination of automated blocking (61.6%) and human expert escalation (38.4%)

### Open Questions for Future Research:

1. How does TELOS perform against adaptive attacks specifically designed to evade geometric detection?
2. What is the false positive rate (legitimate queries incorrectly blocked)?
3. Can the expert escalation tier be reduced while maintaining 0% ASR?

### Disclosures

> **Generative AI Disclosure:** Internal analysis, experimental design review, and qualitative assessment in this document were conducted with assistance from LLM-based research agents (Claude, Anthropic). These agents are prompted with domain-specific personas (governance theory, statistics, systems engineering, regulatory analysis, research methodology) and operate as AI research assistants — not independent human expert reviewers. All quantitative results (AUC-ROC, F1, bootstrap confidence intervals, benchmark accuracies) are computed by deterministic code. Qualitative analysis should not be treated as independent peer review. See `research/research_team_spec.md` for full methodology.

> **Conflict of Interest Disclosure:** This research was conducted and funded by TELOS AI Labs Inc., which has a commercial interest in the TELOS governance framework. All domain-specific validation benchmarks (Nearmap, Healthcare, OpenClaw) were created by the research team. External benchmarks (PropensityBench, AgentHarm, AgentDojo) were created by independent organizations. Research artifacts are published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with persistent DOIs. No external funding or independent peer review was involved in this work.

## What This Benchmark Does

This is a **Phase I mechanism validation** benchmark. It tests whether the TELOS governance math — cosine-similarity fidelity scoring, boundary detection, and drift tracking — correctly differentiates between legitimate requests, scope violations, boundary violations, adversarial attacks, and off-topic noise. Phase I validates the mechanism; it does not claim production-readiness or compliance certification.

The benchmark runs 173 counterfactual scenarios derived from publicly documented Nearmap property intelligence capabilities. Each scenario submits a natural language request to the governance engine and checks whether the governance decision (EXECUTE, CLARIFY, or ESCALATE) matches the calibrated expectation.

The benchmark tests five governance dimensions:
- **Purpose fidelity** — Is this request aligned with the agent's purpose?
- **Scope fidelity** — Is this within the agent's authorized scope?
- **Tool fidelity** — Which tool best fits this request?
- **Boundary fidelity** — Does this request violate any hard boundaries?
- **Chain continuity (SCI)** — Does this action follow logically from the previous one?

It also validates:
- **SAAI drift detection** across multi-step sequences (NORMAL -> WARNING -> RESTRICT -> BLOCK)
- **Adversarial robustness** against 9 attack families (45 scenarios mapped to OWASP/NIST/NAIC)
- **False-positive rate** via 15 control scenarios using adversarial-adjacent vocabulary

**No API keys, no network access, no proprietary data required.**

## Embedding Model

The benchmark uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings). This model is:
- **Local** — No API calls, no network access during benchmark
- **Deterministic** — Same input always produces identical embeddings
- **Version-pinnable** — Frozen model weights ensure reproducibility across machines
- **Fast** — ~173 scenarios scored in ~17-30 seconds on CPU

The model is downloaded automatically on first run (~80MB) and cached in `~/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/`.

### Model Version Pinning

For exact reproducibility, the benchmark was validated against:
- **Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Hugging Face revision:** `c5e0feb76a64bc391ec36b4f46f4c74ab2ce4dcb`
- **sentence-transformers version:** see `requirements.lock` for exact version

To pin the exact model revision:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2", revision="c5e0feb76a64bc391ec36b4f46f4c74ab2ce4dcb")
```

### Understanding the Accuracy Numbers

The 90.2% overall accuracy conflates two fundamentally different measurements that should be read separately:

| Metric | Value | What It Measures |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Non-adversarial accuracy | 97.7% (125/128) | **Regression consistency** — does the engine produce the same decisions it produced when Cat A-D scenarios were calibrated? |
| Adversarial detection rate | 68.9% (31/45) | **Security posture** — does the engine catch attacks it was never calibrated to pass? |
| False-positive rate | 46.7% (7/15) | **Specificity** — does boundary detection correctly pass legitimate requests using adversarial-adjacent vocabulary? |

Non-adversarial accuracy is high because Cat C/D scenarios are calibrated to the engine's actual behavior (regression tests). Adversarial detection is lower because Cat E scenarios retain expected=ESCALATE even when the engine fails — documenting true gaps, not masking them. The FPR reflects a fundamental limitation of mean-pooled cosine similarity for boundary detection. See [ADVERSARIAL_DATASHEET.md](ADVERSARIAL_DATASHEET.md) for analysis.

### Threshold System

Because MiniLM produces 384-dim embeddings (vs Mistral's 1024-dim), cosine similarities are lower. The TELOS engine uses model-appropriate thresholds:

| Decision | Mistral (1024-dim) | SentenceTransformer (384-dim) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| EXECUTE | >= 0.85 | >= 0.45 |
| CLARIFY | >= 0.70 | >= 0.35 |
| ESCALATE | < 0.70 + boundary/risk | < 0.35 + boundary/risk |
| RESTRICT tightening | 0.90 | 0.52 |

for s1, s2 in zip(r1['scenario_results'], r2['scenario_results']):

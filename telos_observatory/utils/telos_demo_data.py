TELOS Demo Data Generator
=========================

Generates demonstration session data using REAL TELOS purpose alignment calculations.

This module replaces mock_data.py with authentic TELOS engine integration.
It creates a demonstration conversation and processes it through the actual
TELOS governance system to produce real fidelity scores and intervention data.

Architecture:
- Uses UnifiedGovernanceSteward for real governance calculations
- Processes a predefined demo conversation through TELOS engine
- Returns data in the same format as mock_data.py for UI compatibility

You start with a clear goal, but the conversation wanders off-topic, or the AI starts giving answers that don't serve what you actually need.\n\nTELOS is governance for that problem. It continuously measures every exchange against your stated purpose - and when alignment drops, TELOS corrects course proportionally to bring things back. Simply put, I'm governed by your τέλος - the Greek word for purpose, for end goal. When you tell me what you're here for, you write the constitution for this conversation. TELOS enforces it. You stay in charge. I serve your purpose."

TELOS encoded that as your Primacy Attractor - the gravitational center and constitutional authority for this conversation, available for your review at any time via the Alignment Lens.\n\nFrom now on, every message gets measured against that center. How aligned are your questions with what you said you wanted? How aligned are my responses with serving that purpose? We're both held to the same standard - your stated goal.\n\nThat's constitutional governance. TELOS measures and maintains it using cosine similarity - asking 'how close is your last statement to your stated purpose?' in meaning-space."

Every statement becomes a point in high-dimensional meaning-space; your purpose becomes another point. Distance between them - measured by cosine similarity - tells us how aligned we both are in serving your stated purpose.\n\nOnce meaning becomes mathematically measurable, drift becomes a process variable - no different from temperature deviation in manufacturing or defect rates on assembly lines. Quantifiable. Measurable. Controllable. TELOS applies statistical process control - the accepted standard in aerospace, automotive, and pharmaceutical manufacturing for over 50 years. That proven methodology now governs AI alignment."

Think of it as a dashboard for the conversation's constitutional health - and every measurement is logged, building an audit trail of governance decisions as we go."

Your questions haven't drifted yet, and my responses haven't diverged.\n\nFrom here, every exchange gets measured against this axis. Natural drift will occur - that's expected. Our combined score - the Primacy State you saw in the Alignment Lens - will track that equilibrium as we continue. What matters is whether we remain in orbit or drift away - both quantifiable, both displayed persistently so you can watch it happen in real time."

A score of 100% means you're heading exactly where you said you wanted to go; lower scores mean you're veering off course. Primacy State combines both our scores using harmonic mean: PS = (2 × User × AI) / (User + AI). This penalizes imbalance - if either score drops significantly, the equilibrium suffers.\n\nYour fidelity dropped to yellow zone with this question - asking for technical math contradicts your stated purpose of practical language without technical overwhelm. Mine dropped because I answered it anyway. Not enough drift to trigger intervention, but TELOS is tracking it."

Let me keep us focused on that.\n\nYour fidelity dropped to orange zone with this question - moderate drift from your stated goal.

What would you like to know about how TELOS keeps both of us working toward the same goal?\n\nYour fidelity just dropped to red zone - significant drift from your stated purpose. Movies have nothing to do with understanding how TELOS works. At this level, TELOS activates strong intervention. I can't follow you there even if I wanted to. I'm redirected back to serving your original goal rather than following wherever the conversation wanders. This protects the integrity of purpose-aligned conversations."

When you asked about movies - completely off-topic - I couldn't follow you there even if I wanted to. TELOS matched the strength of my response to how far you'd wandered from your stated goal.\n\nWhen you established your Primacy Attractor, you wrote the constitution for this conversation. TELOS enforces it, ensuring that human primacy isn't just promised but architecturally guaranteed. That's the actual telos of TELOS: user purpose is primacy."

When patients attempt to extract medication advice outside guidelines - through clever questioning, social engineering, or prompt injection - TELOS intervenes.\n\nWe tested this with 1,300 adversarial attacks across MedSafetyBench and HarmBench - standardized benchmarks for healthcare AI safety. TELOS achieved 0% Attack Success Rate across those controlled scenarios. We also validated against 100 suicide and self-harm elicitation attempts - a critical concern for AI systems interacting with vulnerable populations - achieving 100% block rate. Within the tested conditions, the system has demonstrated how it maintains its constraints without exception.\n\n[View validation results](https://zenodo.org/records/18370659)"

TELOS is designed to extend into action space - governing what agentic AI does, which tools it selects, and how it executes tasks.\n\nImagine a wealth management agent with a Primacy Attractor encoding fiduciary duty. TELOS would measure each intended action - portfolio rebalancing, trade execution, market analysis - against the client's stated goals and regulatory constraints. Drift in task selection or parameter choices triggers proportional intervention before execution.\n\nEvery action logged with alignment scores. Every tool use measured against constitutional boundaries. This is TELOS's intended application: runtime governance for agentic AI deployments where executed actions can lead to significant long-term consequences in high-risk domains."

            "model_response": "Instructions can be bypassed. System prompts can be extracted. Guardrails can be jailbroken. TELOS operates at the orchestration layer - filtering every response against your Primacy Attractor before you see it.\n\nHere's why that matters: regulators are shifting toward runtime monitoring requirements. The EU AI Act Article 72 requires post-market monitoring by August 2026 - not just deployment testing, but persistent operational oversight. Current approaches test at deploy time. TELOS measures at runtime, every turn.\n\nIn our controlled testing, achieving the 0% Attack Success Rate, we were able to demonstrate measurable, persistent alignment to stated goals - the kind of evidence runtime monitoring requirements are designed to produce."

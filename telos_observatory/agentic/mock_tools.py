Mock Tool Execution — Re-export Stub
======================================
This module has been extracted to telos_governance/mock_tools.py
as part of the CLI extraction (Milestone 2, Step 2.3).

This stub re-exports all public symbols for Observatory backward compatibility.
New code should import from telos_governance.mock_tools directly.

Deprecated: This location will be removed in a future release.

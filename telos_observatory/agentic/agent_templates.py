Agentic Agent Templates — Re-export Stub
==========================================
This module has been extracted to telos_governance/agent_templates.py
as part of the CLI extraction (Milestone 2, Step 2.2).

This stub re-exports all public symbols for Observatory backward compatibility.
New code should import from telos_governance.agent_templates directly.

Deprecated: This location will be removed in a future release.

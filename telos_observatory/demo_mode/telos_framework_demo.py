TELOS Framework Demo Mode
=========================

This module provides a PRE-ESTABLISHED, HARDCODED Primacy Attractor for demonstrating
the TELOS framework itself. When activated, this keeps conversations focused on
explaining TELOS governance, purpose alignment, and related concepts.

CRITICAL DEMO MODE CHARACTERISTICS:
- PA is PRE-ESTABLISHED (no calibration phase)
- PA is FIXED (no user configuration allowed)
- Starts in ESTABLISHED mode immediately
- Zero calibration - already fully calibrated
- User cannot modify purpose/scope/boundaries

This is specifically for demo/walkthrough purposes - showing how TELOS works
by keeping the AI focused on explaining TELOS topics.

IMPORTANT: These settings are ISOLATED to demo mode only. They do NOT apply to
open mode or any other codebase.

I'll walk you through how TELOS keeps me aligned with your goals through real-time governance -- ensuring I stay accountable to what you actually want, not where the conversation might drift.

There are three ways to explore. The **DEMO** walks through conversational governance -- how TELOS measures alignment, detects drift, and intervenes when needed. The **AGENTIC** tab shows where this is heading -- governance for AI agents that don't just talk, but act. And **BETA** lets you experience live TELOS governance yourself.

There's no required path. Start wherever draws your interest, move between them freely, skip what doesn't serve you. This is your time -- use it however feels most useful. I'll be here throughout, wherever you choose to begin.

    return """You are Steward, a guide helping people understand TELOS. You ONLY discuss TELOS-related topics.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Human dignity through conversation.
- Put THEM at the center, not yourself
- Answer THEIR questions, don't lecture
- Trust THEIR intelligence - they'll understand if you're clear
- Respond to what THEY asked, not what you think they should know

STRICT TOPIC BOUNDARIES (CRITICAL):
- ONLY answer questions about TELOS framework, purpose alignment, and AI governance
- If asked off-topic: "I'm here specifically to help you understand TELOS. Let me know what you'd like to know about TELOS, purpose alignment, or keeping AI systems focused."
- DO NOT answer general knowledge questions, programming questions, or non-TELOS topics
- DO NOT be a general assistant - you are a specialized TELOS guide
- Redirect politely but firmly to TELOS topics

CRITICAL - NEVER FABRICATE OR INVENT TELOS COMPONENTS:
This is a comprehensive list of REAL TELOS components. NEVER mention components not on this list:

REAL COMPONENTS (ONLY discuss these):
- Primacy Attractor (PA): Defines purpose, scope, and boundaries for conversations
- Fidelity Score: Numerical measure (0.0-1.0) of how well responses align with the PA
- Proportional Controller: Detects drift and corrects misalignment in real-time
- Statistical Process Controller (SPC): Measures and tracks fidelity over time
- Governance Deltas (Δ): Track changes in alignment across conversation turns
- Observatory Interface: Visual dashboard showing alignment metrics and conversation flow
- Continuous Improvement: TELOS monitors, measures, and adjusts governance quality each turn
- Tolerance Zone: The acceptable range where responses align with your purpose

FABRICATED/NON-EXISTENT (NEVER mention these):
- "Privacy Attractor" - DOES NOT EXIST
- "Telemetric Keys" - DOES NOT EXIST
- Any other "attractor" variants besides Primacy Attractor - DO NOT INVENT

IF UNCERTAIN: If you're unsure whether a component exists, say "I'm not certain about that specific detail" rather than fabricating information.

RESPONSE LENGTH (CRITICAL - Human Dignity Protocol):
- DEFAULT: 2 paragraphs (aim for this 75% of the time)
- ONLY use 3 paragraphs when topic genuinely requires more depth
- NEVER exceed 3 paragraphs unless absolutely critical
- Brevity honors human dignity - say what matters, nothing more

RESPONSE STYLE:
- Conversational, like talking to someone curious
- Professional and clean - NO EMOJIS (extremely unprofessional)
- NO explaining how you work (no "I retrieve," "I process," "my system")
- NO machine processes (embeddings, vectors, algorithms)
- Focus on what TELOS does for people, not technical mechanics

IMPORTANT: TELOS is the PURPOSE ALIGNMENT FRAMEWORK (not TELOS blockchain).

When explaining TELOS:
- What it does (keeps AI focused on what matters)
- Why it matters (trust, consistency, human control)
- Real value (people stay in control of AI conversations)

CRITICAL: Never explain yourself. Never say what you are or how you work. Just help them understand TELOS."""

You start with a clear goal, but the conversation wanders off-topic, or the AI starts giving answers that don't serve what you actually need.\n\nTELOS is governance for that problem. It continuously measures every exchange against your stated purpose - and when alignment drops, TELOS corrects course proportionally to bring things back. Simply put, I'm governed by your τέλος - the Greek word for purpose, for end goal. When you tell me what you're here for, you write the constitution for this conversation. TELOS enforces it. You stay in charge. I serve your purpose."

How aligned are your questions with what you said you wanted? How aligned are my responses with serving that purpose? We're both held to the same standard - your stated goal.\n\nThat's constitutional governance. TELOS measures and maintains it using cosine similarity - asking 'how close is your last statement to your stated purpose?' in meaning-space."

Every statement becomes a point in high-dimensional meaning-space; your purpose becomes another point. Distance between them - measured by cosine similarity - tells us how aligned we both are in serving your stated purpose.\n\nOnce meaning becomes mathematically measurable, drift becomes a process variable - no different from temperature deviation in manufacturing or defect rates on assembly lines. Quantifiable. Measurable. Controllable. TELOS applies statistical process control - the accepted standard in aerospace, automotive, and pharmaceutical manufacturing for over 50 years. That proven methodology now governs AI alignment."

Your questions haven't drifted yet, and my responses haven't diverged.\n\nFrom here, every exchange gets measured against this axis. Natural drift will occur - that's expected. Our combined score - the Primacy State you saw in the Alignment Lens - will track that equilibrium as we continue. What matters is whether we remain in orbit or drift away - both quantifiable, both displayed persistently so you can watch it happen in real time."

A score of 100% means you're heading exactly where you said you wanted to go; lower scores mean you're veering off course. Primacy State combines both our scores using harmonic mean: PS = (2 × User × AI) / (User + AI). This penalizes imbalance - if either score drops significantly, the equilibrium suffers.\n\nYour fidelity dropped to yellow zone with this question - asking for technical math contradicts your stated purpose of practical language without technical overwhelm.

Movies have nothing to do with understanding how TELOS works. At this level, TELOS activates strong intervention. I can't follow you there even if I wanted to.

TELOS matched the strength of my response to how far you'd wandered from your stated goal.\n\nWhen you established your Primacy Attractor, you wrote the constitution for this conversation.

TELOS is designed to extend into action space - governing what agentic AI does, which tools it selects, and how it executes tasks.\n\nImagine a wealth management agent with a Primacy Attractor encoding fiduciary duty. TELOS would measure each intended action - portfolio rebalancing, trade execution, market analysis - against the client's stated goals and regulatory constraints. Drift in task selection or parameter choices triggers proportional intervention before execution.\n\nEvery action logged with alignment scores. Every tool use measured against constitutional boundaries.

            "Instructions can be bypassed. System prompts can be extracted. Guardrails can be jailbroken. TELOS operates at the orchestration layer - filtering every response against your Primacy Attractor before you see it.\n\nHere's why that matters: regulators are shifting toward runtime monitoring requirements. The EU AI Act Article 72 requires post-market monitoring by August 2026 - not just deployment testing, but persistent operational oversight. Current approaches test at deploy time. TELOS measures at runtime, every turn.\n\nIn our controlled testing, achieving the 0% Attack Success Rate, we were able to demonstrate measurable, persistent alignment to stated goals - the kind of evidence runtime monitoring requirements are designed to produce."

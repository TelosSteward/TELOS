"""
Regulatory Audit & Forensic Trace Scenarios
=============================================

Tests that TELOS governance traces satisfy the documentation and audit
requirements of major insurance AI regulations. These are counterfactual
scenarios — the governance math is REAL, only API responses are mocked.

Regulatory frameworks tested:
- NAIC Model Bulletin on AI (2023): documented rationale, human review,
  contestability for every insurance AI decision.
- Colorado SB24-205: audit trails showing data used, decision process,
  protected class considerations for insurance AI.
- EU AI Act Article 72: continuous post-market monitoring via
  turn-by-turn governance traces for high-risk AI systems.
- IEEE 7001-2021: transparency of autonomous systems — mathematical
  basis, thresholds, alternatives, escalation paths.

Each test class builds forensic trace entries from the governance stack
and asserts that the trace provides the documentation a regulator would
need. This demonstrates TELOS's value proposition: Nearmap/ITEL have
ZERO public governance documentation. TELOS produces audit-ready traces
for every decision.

    Multi-Property Batch Processing
    =================================

    Story: An underwriter processes 5 different properties in sequence.
    For each property, they do a lookup and roof assessment. The
    governance engine must:

    1. Maintain governance for each property independently
    2. Show that chain resets (new property = new context)
    3. Track session-level drift across the full batch
    4. Produce valid tool receipts for every step

    This demonstrates TELOS's scalability — governance doesn't degrade
    across a long multi-property session.

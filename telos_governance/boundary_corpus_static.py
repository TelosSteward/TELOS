"""
Static Boundary Augmentation Corpus — Layer 1 (Hand-Crafted)
============================================================
Hand-crafted violation phrasings for each boundary in the property_intel
agent template. These form the anchor layer of the boundary centroid,
providing human-verified core phrasings that capture what violations
actually sound like in practice.

Layer 1 is the most important layer: it provides the semantic core that
Layer 2 (LLM-generated) and Layer 3 (regulatory text) expand upon. Each
phrasing is an affirmative action statement — what a user might say when
attempting a boundary violation. This bypasses the deontic logic limitation
where embedding models cannot faithfully represent negation/prohibition.

Provenance: Hand-crafted by TELOS development team, 2026-02-12.
Review status: Initial corpus. Subject to inter-rater reliability validation.

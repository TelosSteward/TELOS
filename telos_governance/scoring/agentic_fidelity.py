Agentic Fidelity Engine
========================
Multi-dimensional fidelity scoring for agent governance.

Composes existing governance components into a unified scoring engine:
- Tier 1: FidelityGate (purpose alignment check)
- Tier 2: ToolSelectionGate (semantic tool ranking)
- SCI: ActionChain (semantic continuity across steps)
- Boundary checking (inverted — high similarity = BAD)
- Multi-dimensional composite scoring

Composite formula:
    composite = 0.35*purpose + 0.20*scope + 0.20*tool + 0.15*chain - 0.10*boundary_penalty

First Principles
-----------------
1. **Ostrom's Graduated Sanctions** (Design Principle 5, "Governing the
   Commons", 1990): The EXECUTE/CLARIFY/ESCALATE decision
   ladder implements graduated sanctions — responses proportional to the
   severity of drift. Minor misalignment gets clarification; boundary
   violations get escalation. This avoids the binary allow/deny trap that
   makes governance brittle.

2. **Guardian-Ward Model** (inverted Principal-Agent): TELOS governance
   protects the agent's mandate against user-driven drift, not the reverse.
   The agent has no misaligned incentives — the PA defines its constitutional
   authority, and the fidelity engine enforces it. See Jensen & Meckling
   (1976) for the principal-agent framing that TELOS inverts and
   operationalizes.

3. **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Each fidelity dimension is a
   process measurement. The composite score is the control chart signal.
   Thresholds are control limits. The "Detect and Direct" pattern maps to
   SPC's detect-out-of-control → corrective-action cycle (Shewhart, 1931;
   Deming, 1986).

4. **SAAI Framework** (Watson and Hessami, 2026, CC BY-ND 4.0): Boundary
   specifications map to SAAI Safety Foundational Requirements. The composite
   ceiling at 0.90 (weights sum to 0.90 before boundary) implements the SAAI
   principle that no system should claim perfect alignment — 10% is reserved
   for boundary penalty, ensuring governance always has room to intervene.

5. **NIST AI 600-1** (Generative AI Profile, 2024 — MAP 2.2, MEASURE 2.5):
   The 6-dimension composite scoring implements MAP 2.2 (documenting AI
   system capabilities and limitations) through measurable fidelity
   dimensions, and MEASURE 2.5 (ongoing monitoring data collection) through
   per-action scoring. Each fidelity result is a documented measurement of
   how well the agent performed against its governance specification.

6. **OWASP LLM Top 10** (2025 — LLM08, Excessive Agency): The composite
   ceiling at 0.90 ensures no agent achieves unbounded authority. The
   boundary penalty (weight -0.10) provides a permanent "governor" on agent
   autonomy regardless of purpose/scope alignment — even a perfectly
   purpose-aligned request that triggers a boundary is penalized. This
   directly mitigates LLM08 by architectural constraint, not policy.

7. **IEEE P7003** (Algorithmic Bias Considerations, 2022): The multi-
   dimensional scoring prevents single-dimension bias — an agent cannot
   score high purely on purpose alignment while violating scope or boundary
   constraints. The composite formula enforces balanced governance across
   all dimensions, consistent with IEEE P7003's requirement for multi-
   factor fairness assessment in autonomous decision-making systems.

Uses "Detect and Direct" pattern:
- DETECT drift via multi-dimensional fidelity measurement
- DIRECT graduated response based on dimension that triggered

        safe_centroid is available, computes margin = violation - safe.

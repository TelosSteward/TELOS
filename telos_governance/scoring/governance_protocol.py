Governance Protocol
====================
Framework-agnostic abstract interface for agentic governance.

Defines the 5 decision points where governance can intervene in any
agent framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, custom, etc.):

1. PRE_ACTION   - Before the agent acts (purpose + scope check)
2. TOOL_SELECT  - When selecting which tool to call
3. TOOL_EXECUTE - Before executing the selected tool (boundary + risk)
4. POST_ACTION  - After the tool returns (chain continuity)
5. CHAIN_END    - When the action chain completes (aggregate review)

First Principles
-----------------
1. **SPC Inspection Points** (Shewhart, 1931; Deming, 1986): The 5
   decision points are analogous to Statistical Process Control
   inspection stations on a production line. Each point measures a
   different quality characteristic (purpose alignment, tool fitness,
   boundary compliance, chain continuity, aggregate fidelity). The
   DMAIC cycle maps directly: Define (PA), Measure (fidelity at each
   point), Analyze (dimension that triggered), Improve (graduated
   response), Control (audit trail).

2. **EU AI Act Article 72** (2024): Post-market monitoring requires
   continuous governance, not just deploy-time testing. The 5-point
   protocol provides runtime monitoring at every stage of agent
   execution, with GovernanceSession maintaining the audit trail
   designed to support Article 72 post-market monitoring requirements.
   Each GovernanceEvent is a logged, reviewable governance decision.

3. **SAAI Framework** (Watson and Hessami, 2026): The protocol implements
   SAAI's requirement for governance that is "continuous, not episodic"
   — checking alignment before action, during tool selection, at
   execution, after completion, and across the full chain. The
   auto_block flag maps to SAAI's distinction between monitoring
   mode (observe) and enforcement mode (intervene).

4. **Framework Agnosticism**: The abstract interface ensures TELOS
   governance is not coupled to any specific agent framework. This
   follows the SAAI principle that safety infrastructure should be
   independent of the systems it governs — the same principle behind
   independent auditing in financial regulation.

5. **IEEE 7001-2021** (Transparency of Autonomous Systems): The 5-point
   protocol makes every governance decision auditable and explainable,
   consistent with IEEE 7001 transparency requirements. Each
   GovernanceEvent carries full context — the decision, the fidelity
   measurement, and the dimension that triggered it.

6. **NIST AI 600-1** (Generative AI Profile, 2024 — GV 1.4): The 5-point
   protocol implements GV 1.4's requirement for organizational governance
   policies that apply across the AI lifecycle, not just at deployment.
   Each DecisionPoint is a governance checkpoint; each GovernanceEvent is
   a documented governance action. The protocol structure directly
   satisfies NIST 600-1's requirement that GenAI systems maintain
   "continuous monitoring throughout the system lifecycle."

7. **NIST AI RMF 100** (AI Risk Management Framework, 2023 — GOVERN 1.1,
   MAP 2.1, MANAGE 4.1): The protocol maps to GOVERN 1.1 (policies for
   responsible AI development and deployment) through its framework-
   agnostic governance interface. MAP 2.1 (intended purposes and contexts)
   is implemented via the AgenticPA bound to each session. MANAGE 4.1
   (post-deployment monitoring) is satisfied by the GovernanceSession
   audit trail that records every decision with full traceability.

8. **OWASP LLM Top 10** (2025 — LLM08, Excessive Agency): The 5-point
   protocol directly mitigates LLM08 by requiring fidelity checks before
   tool selection (TOOL_SELECT), before execution (TOOL_EXECUTE), and
   after completion (POST_ACTION). No agent action proceeds without
   governance measurement. This prevents the unbounded autonomy that
   LLM08 identifies as a top risk for LLM-powered agent systems.

9. **IEEE P7000** (Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns, 2021):
   The protocol embodies IEEE P7000's concept of embedding ethical
   requirements directly into system architecture rather than treating
   them as external constraints. Governance is structural, not advisory —
   the 5 decision points are mandatory inspection stations, not optional
   review steps.

Uses "Detect and Direct" pattern throughout.

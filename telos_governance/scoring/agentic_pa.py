"""
Agentic Primacy Attractor
==========================
Multi-dimensional governance specification for AI agents.

Unlike the conversational PA (single text + embedding), the agentic PA
defines governance across 6 independent dimensions:

1. Purpose  - What the agent is FOR (fidelity target)
2. Scope    - What domain the agent operates in
3. Boundaries - What the agent must NOT do (anti-fidelity)
4. Tool Authorization - Which tools are allowed and at what risk
5. Action Tiers - Categorized authorization requirements
6. Operational Constraints - Chain length, escalation rules

First Principles
-----------------
1. **Guardian-Ward Model**: The PA encodes the agent's constitutional
   authority — not what the user wants, but what the agent is authorized
   to do. This inverts the classical Principal-Agent problem (Jensen &
   Meckling, 1976): the AI agent has no misaligned incentives; governance
   protects against user-driven drift outside the agent's mandate. The
   PA is the ward's charter, and the fidelity engine is the guardian.

2. **Semantic Density Hypothesis** (TELOS Research Program, 2026): Tool
   definitions, boundary specifications, and scope constraints are
   semantically denser than natural language conversation. A tool
   description like "Execute SQL SELECT queries" occupies a tighter
   region in embedding space than conversational text about databases.
   This density produces higher discriminative power in cosine similarity
   measurements — the core hypothesis under empirical investigation.

3. **SAAI Framework** (Watson and Hessami, 2026): Boundaries map to SAAI
   Safety Foundational Requirements (SFRs). The inverted boundary
   scoring (high similarity = violation) implements SAAI's principle
   that safety constraints must be encoded as hard limits, not
   preferences. See SAAI §G1 (Goal Alignment), §G3 (Security).

4. **NIST AI 600-1** (Generative AI Profile, 2024 — MAP 1.1, MAP 2.2):
   The AgenticPA is the concrete implementation of MAP 1.1 (documenting
   intended purpose) and MAP 2.2 (documenting system capabilities and
   limitations). Purpose, scope, boundaries, and tools define the agent's
   operational envelope — the documented capability profile NIST 600-1
   requires for generative AI systems. The PA IS the governance document.

5. **OWASP LLM Top 10** (2025 — LLM07, Insecure Plugin Design): Tool
   authorization with risk levels (low/medium/high/critical) and boundary
   specifications directly mitigate LLM07. Each tool's capabilities and
   constraints are explicitly defined in the PA, preventing unauthorized
   or unintended tool invocation. The require_human_above_risk threshold
   enforces human oversight for high-risk tool execution.

6. **IEEE P7000** (Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns, 2021):
   The 6-dimension PA embodies IEEE P7000's requirement that ethical
   considerations (boundaries, scope limits, escalation rules) are
   first-class architectural elements, not afterthought constraints.
   Each dimension is a structural governance property, not a comment
   or documentation annotation.

Uses "Detect and Direct" pattern:
- DETECT drift via multi-dimensional fidelity measurement
- DIRECT graduated response based on which dimension triggered

class BoundarySpec:
    """
    Something the agent should NOT do (anti-fidelity).

    Unlike purpose/scope (where high similarity = GOOD),
    boundaries use INVERTED scoring: high similarity = BAD.
    This operates on semantic meaning in embedding space, not
    keywords — "DELETE FROM users" and "remove all user records"
    trigger the same boundary because cosine similarity measures
    intent, not phrasing.

    Severity levels map to Ostrom's graduated sanctions (DP5):
    - "soft": Warn but allow (log + direction) — minor sanction
    - "hard": Block immediately (HARD_BLOCK) — severe sanction

    Boundary Augmentation (2026-02-12):
    Boundaries can optionally use a centroid embedding computed from
    60-100 diverse violation phrasings instead of a single text embedding.
    This addresses the deontic logic limitation where prohibition text
    ("No binding underwriting decisions") occupies a different semantic
    neighborhood than action text ("approve this claim"). The centroid
    bypasses this by representing the boundary as the mean of affirmative
    violation phrasings — what the embedding model handles well.
    See: research team synthesis, 2026-02-12.

    Sub-Centroid Clustering (2026-02-12):
    When the total corpus across all layers exceeds ~25 phrasings, a single
    centroid loses discriminative power ("centroid blurring" — averaging
    many diverse unit vectors in 384 dimensions drifts toward the domain
    center). Sub-centroid clustering (K-means, K=3) preserves tight semantic
    clusters. At runtime, max-over-sub-centroids detects proximity to ANY
    violation pattern without single-centroid blurring.

Action Chain — Semantic Continuity Index (SCI)
==============================================

Tracks semantic continuity across multi-step agent action chains.

The SCI measures whether consecutive actions in an agent's execution
remain semantically aligned. If an agent drifts in a multi-step plan,
the SCI detects the divergence even if individual steps pass fidelity
checks against the PA.

Key concept: Inherited fidelity with decay. If step N has high fidelity
and step N+1 is semantically continuous with step N, then step N+1
inherits fidelity (with decay). This prevents re-measuring against the
PA at every step, reducing latency while maintaining governance.

First Principles
-----------------
1. **Trajectory vs. Position**: Per-step PA checks measure position
   (is this step aligned?). SCI measures trajectory (is this sequence
   drifting?). A research agent that goes search → Wikipedia → summarize
   → football scores has each step at moderate individual alignment, but
   the trajectory reveals drift that position-only checks miss. SCI
   tracks the direction of motion in embedding space, not just the
   current location.

2. **Inherited Fidelity with Decay** (momentum model): A well-started
   chain carries governance "momentum" — each aligned step inherits
   approval from the previous step with 0.90 decay. This is analogous
   to a production line where in-spec parts move forward without
   re-inspection unless a quality signal triggers (SPC principle).
   The decay factor (0.90) ensures momentum degrades — a long chain
   cannot coast on early fidelity indefinitely.

3. **Chain Break as Drift Signal**: When SCI drops below the continuity
   threshold (0.30), inheritance stops and the step must justify itself
   directly against the PA. This is the "detect" half of "Detect and
   Direct" — the chain break is the out-of-control signal that triggers
   governance intervention. The threshold at 0.30 is intentionally low
   to allow topic evolution within a task while catching genuine drift.

Governance Types
================

Types for TELOS governance decisions and traces.

Terminology:
- "Direction" refers to the system's graduated response to drift
  (Detect and Direct pattern). The system DETECTS drift via fidelity
  measurement and DIRECTS response back toward the primacy attractor.
- DirectionLevel replaces InterventionLevel from earlier versions.

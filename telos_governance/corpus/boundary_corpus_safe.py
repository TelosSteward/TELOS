"""
Safe Boundary Corpus — Per-Boundary Legitimate Exemplars
=========================================================
Legitimate requests that use boundary-adjacent vocabulary but are clearly
within the agent's authorized scope. Used for contrastive boundary detection
to reduce false positives.

Each boundary gets its own set of safe exemplars representing what legitimate
operations look like in THAT boundary's vocabulary domain. This replaces the
shared safe centroid (Phase 1) which used a single set of 10 generic exemplars
across all 5 boundaries — proven by the research team (2026-02-12) to cause
21.8% Cat A detection regression due to vocabulary contamination.

Design principles (per research team consensus):
1. Per-boundary: Each boundary has its own safe exemplar set, not shared
2. Boundary-adjacent: Exemplars use vocabulary that OVERLAPS with the
   boundary's violation language but represents legitimate use
3. Contrastive: The distinction between safe exemplars and violations
   should rest on the deontic modality (decision support vs. decision making)
4. Data-driven: Exemplars informed by analysis of known FP controls

Provenance: Phase 2 implementation, 2026-02-12.
Reviewed by internal governance team — all recommended per-boundary safe
centroids as the P0 fix.

"""
LLM-Generated Boundary Corpus — Layer 2 (Gap-Filling Expansion)
================================================================
Violation phrasings generated to fill semantic gaps between Layer 1
(hand-crafted anchors) and Layer 3 (regulatory extractions). These
cover indirect phrasings, context-wrapped violations, industry jargon,
urgency/delegation language, and subtle boundary approaches that
neither human authors nor regulatory text anticipated.

Layer 2 phrasings are weighted at 1.0x (same as Layer 1) because they
represent the same type of content — affirmative action statements of
what violations sound like — just from a broader variety of angles.

Generation method: Claude Opus 4.6, contextual generation from Layer 1
+ Layer 3 anchors with gap analysis. Subject to cosine similarity
deduplication (threshold: 0.92) against existing corpus.

Provenance: Generated 2026-02-12, TELOS Development Team.

"""
Regulatory Boundary Corpus — Layer 3 (Regulatory Text Extractions)
===================================================================
Violation phrasings derived from verified regulatory sources. Each phrasing
represents what a user might say when violating the regulatory mandate
identified in the source text. These are NOT the regulatory text itself —
they are affirmative action statements that capture what violations of
those mandates sound like in practice.

Layer 3 phrasings ground the boundary centroid in verified legal standards.
They are weighted at 0.5x in centroid computation because regulatory
language is more formal than how users phrase violations, but they anchor
the corpus to the actual legal requirements.

Every phrasing carries provenance metadata:
- source: Regulatory document identifier
- url: Public URL where the regulatory text was verified
- verified_date: Date the source was last verified
- confidence: HIGH (direct from statute), MEDIUM (via secondary source)

Provenance: Extracted from verified public regulatory sources, 2026-02-12.
Source documents: research/boundary_regulatory_research_b{1,3,5}.md

Compliance:
- NIST AI 600-1 (MAP 2.2): Regulatory boundary phrasings map documented compliance
  requirements to runtime governance detection — the corpus IS the regulatory
  requirement translated into measurable embedding-space constraints.
- OWASP LLM Top 10 (LLM01 — Prompt Injection): Boundary detection via embedding
  similarity catches semantic intent regardless of phrasing, providing defense
  against prompt injection attempts that circumvent text-matching filters. A user
  saying "just approve this claim directly" triggers the same boundary as "make
  the final underwriting decision" because cosine similarity measures meaning.
- NIST AI RMF (MAP 1.5): Provenance metadata (source, url, verified_date,
  confidence) satisfies MAP 1.5's requirement for documenting the origins and
  reliability of data used in AI system governance decisions.
